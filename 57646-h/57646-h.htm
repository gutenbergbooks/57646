<h2>
PREFACE.
</h2>

<p>
In publishing the following account of a journey across
Tibet and China, it has been my object to describe in a
simple manner all that I did and saw from beginning to
end, in the hope that some future traveller may learn, not
so much what he ought to do, as what he ought not to do.
</p>

<p>
Those who have experienced the charms of a nomad's
life, will, I trust, be once more reminded of happy days of
freedom, will sympathise with us in our difficulties, and
share the pleasures which they alone can appreciate.
Should others, by chance, find some little interest in
perusing these pages, and be tempted to taste for themselves
the sweets of wandering through little known lands, they
will be recompensed for doing so, and I shall have found my
reward.
</p>

<p>
To those who patiently read to the end and close the
book with a feeling of disappointment, I would appeal for
leniency. Begun as it was at Lucknow, amid the distractions
of polo, racing, and field-days, continued at Simla,
India's summer capital, and finished in the wilds of
Waziristan, it can lay no claim to literary or scientific
merit, but only to being a plain story plainly told; and as
such I give it to the public.
</p>

<p>
For the chapter on the Mohammedan rebellion in China,
my thanks are due to my friend Mr. Ridley, of the "China
Inland Mission," who lived in the very midst of the scene
of trouble, and who kindly allowed me to make every use
of his notes. They are likewise due to Sir Claude and
Lady Macdonald, whose kindness and hospitality in Pekin
can never be forgotten, and lastly, to those three faithful
ones who stuck to us through thick and thin.
</p>

<p>
The names of Duffadar Shahzad Mir, Lassoo, and Esa
Tsareng—known throughout as "Esau"—will always call
to my mind three men without whom this journey could
never have been accomplished, and in saying this I know
that I am also expressing the feelings of my companion,
Lieut. Malcolm.

CHAPTER I.
</h2>
<p class="ch_summ20">
PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY—MALCOLM GOES ON AHEAD.
</p>

<p>
About the beginning of March, 1896, whilst the Inter-Regimental
Polo Tournament was being held at Umballa,
an occasion when representatives of regiments from all
parts of India are gathered together, Lieutenant Malcolm,
of the 93rd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and I,
agreed to join forces in an expedition through Tibet. Our
resolve was to traverse the northern portions of this little-known
country from west to east, to find out, if possible,
what mysteries lay beneath the word <span class="smcap">UNEXPLORED</span> with
which alone our latest maps were enlightened; furthermore
to discover and locate the source of the Chu Ma river,
which was supposed to be a source of the Yangtse Kiang;
finally to cross the Tsaidam and end up our wanderings at
the celestial capital of China. During the few weeks that
remained before we should be able to take our leave, we
were unfortunately quartered at different places many miles
apart, consequently all our arrangements had to be carried
out by post and wire. It was towards the end of March
when we left our respective stations of Nowshera and
Umballa. I remember well the mail train to Rawal Pindi
one bright morning gliding from the latter station past the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
well-known grassy maidan, then worn to a dirty dusty
brown by reason of the morning tramp of small mixed
armies, and by the equally keen and destructive work of
numerous polo players during the latter half of the day.
</p>

<p>
On occasions like this, the thought quite naturally arises
in one's mind, "Is everything here? Has my faithful
bearer left anything behind?" Let us see what was with
me in the carriage. In one corner lay my rifles; these
consisted of a ·308 with Martini-Henry action, and 300
rounds of ammunition with Jeffery's split bullets, a sporting
carbine with 200 rounds, a shot-gun with 300, and a couple
of government cavalry carbines with 100. These latter we
brought not in the hope of using, but rather to lessen
the chance of a skirmish with any natives showing hostile
intentions, by merely making a display of them. The
knowledge of a caravan being well armed and equipped,
however small it may be, is very often a battle half
won amongst unsophisticated inhabitants of little-known
countries. The other rifles, for game, we selected chiefly
for their handiness and the lightness of the ammunition,
although a double-barrelled express may be equally or more
destructive. All the ammunition was placed in government
tin-lined wooden boxes, with rope handles.
</p>

<p>
Here, too, were our scientific instruments: A three-inch
theodolite and stand, a six-inch sextant, three aneroid barometers,
a hypsometer, maximum and minimum thermometers,
plane table and stand, prismatic compass, and field glasses.
Besides this we had a drying press for flowers, skinning
knives, with alum and arsenical soap, a butterfly net, and
a kodak; also the best map of the country we could lay our
hands on, and a few stiff books, such as the "History of
the Indian Empire," where the dullest mind and imagination
can find unlimited food, for there are times on trips of
this description when bad weather or illness may prevent
outdoor progress, and the brain will at once cry out for an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
innings. Close by lay a despatch box and medicine chest,
containing, for man's ailments, quinine, Cockle's pills,
chlorodyne, auberge for colds, antipyrine, antiseptic wool,
vaseline, and kola nut, the last named being particularly
useful, for a small piece the size of a pea has been known
to sustain strength and energy at the most urgent times;
there were also mustard plasters, which are always effective
for sticking on natives of any uncivilized country,
Tibetans themselves being especially partial to this kind of
medicinal adornment. For the mules and ponies, whose
chief and probably only ailment would be the suffering
from sore backs, we carried sugar-of-lead ointment and
cyona. There lay, too, a small chair, a bundle of warm
blankets and waterproof sheets, and a box containing twenty
chain hobbles with bolt screw. We had learnt from Bower,
who had crossed Tibet some five years previously, that one
of the greatest delays was caused by the straying of the
animals at night-time, and against this annoyance we were
resolved to protect ourselves. These were very simply
made. By way of a portable kitchen we had laid in a
box of cooking utensils, consisting of some steel degchies
and a frying pan. The stores were placed in six boxes,
each weighing about thirty pounds, and made up principally
of tea, cocoa, Lazenby's soup squares, Brand's essences,
candles, matches, some sardines and bully beef, with three
bottles of good brandy. In the luggage van were also two
government cavalry saddles, with carbine bucket, wallets,
and wooden stirrups, for we had been led to believe that
the cold would be intense, and that metal stirrups would
probably produce a frost-bite. Lastly, though more precious,
was my little fox terrier, Ruby, so full of life and
spirits at starting, yet in happy ignorance of the undeserved
fate that overtook her some seven or eight months later.
</p>

<p>
Unlike many Indian trains, where, too, the fashion would
have suited me far better, this particular train landed me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
punctually at Rawal Pindi at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Despite this unearthly
hour and the drizzling rain, I was a little surprised to find
my special tonga awaiting me, though it proved insufficient
for carrying all the luggage. Leaving my little terrier to
take charge of this, I embarked on to a wooden springless
box, pulled by a mule, and steered for the nearest serai,
in hopes of being quickly able to find an ecka. Here I
squeezed through some bars of the large wooden gates
which were supposed to keep out night intruders, and any
sleeping inmate who lay in the various rooms I prodded
with my stick, and demanded an ecka. None of these,
however, at such an hour, would accede with any kind
of willingness to my proposals. Some absolutely refused
to awake, while others who did, strongly objected to being
roused and to helping me. The only arrangement that
would suit any of these men at all was, that twenty-five
rupees should be paid instead of the proper fare of eighteen.
In that case, and providing that my luggage was brought to
the serai, and that there were not too many things, they
agreed to start for Baramula when they felt inclined.
Bribes, threats, and even blows were of no avail, and
finally, being opposed by superior numbers, I retreated,
and sad to say not gracefully, for I had to squeeze through
those bars again. Another ride in the box brought me to
a second serai, where I luckily fell in with a choudrie, who
produced an ecka with so stout a pony that he reached
the station before I could in my mule box. Here the
ecka was loaded and sent on in advance, shortly to be
overtaken by my tonga, for a tonga will cover the journey
of 160 miles to Baramula in two days, while an ecka takes
about five. The only difficulty that arose this morning
was the constant jibbing of the horses, and had they not
the providential dodge of repeatedly collapsing and lying
down, I should undoubtedly have rattled down some open
precipice. Despite this delay, I reached the well-known
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
hill station of Murree for 10 o'clock breakfast. From
here the road was heavy, and had not some gangs of
long-suffering coolies, who were working on the road, come
to our assistance, the tonga would be there now. That
evening we reached Domel, where a tumbledown shanty
had supplanted, for the time being, a well-built bungalow
which had recently been washed away by heavy rains and
snow. In one respect this was an ill-chosen spot to spend
the night at, as the horses had to be taken away for shelter
some three miles off, I was told, and to induce natives to
bring the tonga ready to start by daybreak was as difficult
as to squeeze blood out of a stone.

<p>
By 7 o'clock, however, we were once more rolling along
in dripping rain, with the everlasting but somewhat
monotonous roar of the river Jhelum below us, so that it
was a decided relief to stop for breakfast, even at an inn
like that at Chagoti, where I could hardly mount the slippery
steps that lead up to the entrance, benumbed as I was by
wet and cold, and cramped from several hours of the same
position, for the constant downpour prevented any stretching
of legs when changing horses at the various stages. In
somewhat heavier rain we journeyed on through slush and
mud, and arrived at Baramula about sunset. It was my
intention to have embarked here at once on to one of the
river boats and reach Srinagar as quickly as possible. But
darkness and rain, and an inviting light from the adjacent
dak bungalow dissolved these plans, and I was soon ushered
inside by a Kashmiri, by name Mahomed Malik. This man
was to be our cook on the expedition; he was armed with
several letters of recommendation, amongst others from
Curzon and Littledale, and had doubtless travelled over a
great portion of Asia, and we vainly congratulated ourselves
on having managed to pick up a servant with so much
experience. I was struck, too, by his pleasant appearance,
his quiet yet quick and business-like way of doing things,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
little knowing at the time that he had at heart no real
intention of accompanying us, but merely of buying the
articles required for our expedition, and persuading us to
buy a great many unnecessary ones, in order to reap a
small fortune from the transaction.

</div>

<p>
From experience gained on this trip and on others, I
prefer servants of all descriptions, with the exception of
guides pure and simple, to be men who have made no
previous journeys. Although the possession of letters
explaining what good men they have been on previous
journeys is a useful recommendation, still it can never
guarantee what they will be like. Many of them, after
receiving liberal and well-deserved pay for their services,
become inflated with their own importance and vainly think
that no expedition can manage without them. Besides,
men of this description are far more expensive articles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
than the fresh and keener man, anxious to make his first
essay. It is hardly worth while, too, to quote the proverb
about the fish and the sea. The following morning, I
found myself being towed up the river towards Srinagar,
fairly sheltered from the incessant rain by the matting
that forms a roof to these boats, or doongas, as they are
locally called. The water was thick and brown, no view
of the famous snow-capped peaks or pine-clad mountains
could be seen, all was obscured in damp dreariness, and
my thoughts fled back to those I had left to enjoy the
sunny plains below. Nor was there any more inducement
on the morrow to slip out from between the blankets and
admire the wonderful scenery of these parts. I continued
to prolong the night until my boat was suddenly boarded
by one of the chief agents of Srinagar, a member of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
Sumud Shah family, so renowned for their Jewish appearance
and ways, and for their partiality in buying and
selling all kinds of goods, and for lending or borrowing
money to any amount in any shape or form. There was a
second invader, a moment afterwards, by name Ramzana,
who was a chapliwalla, or seller of chaplies, which are
shoes made of leather and straps, and are worn by most
sportsmen who shoot in Kashmir; besides these he sold
everything that man's imagination could conceive as being
made of leather, but, it should be added, of an inferior
kind. They brought with them some large brass plates
loaded with white almonds, sweets, and dried currants, and
placing them beside my bed as a friendly initiative to
business, began to ramble on, with beaming faces, about
the superiority yet cheapness of their own goods, and of
their eternal willingness to provide me and my friends who
might come to Kashmir with them, at all places and at
all times.

About midday the clouds began to lift, and having
lightened my cargo of these persevering Jews, I decided to
take a muddy walk and finish the last eight or nine miles
on foot. Part of the way lay along the Baramula and
Srinagar road, along which tongas should certainly be able
to ply the following year, and if the many heaps of flints
that were lying alongside were beaten down into the road
itself, there is every chance of its being able to withstand
the traffic. On either side, too, was a row of dwarf poplars,
or "pruss" as they are called by the Kashmiris, beautifully
planted in line at about a yard interval, doubtless helping
to make the drive pleasant and shady enough.

By the river side were men breaking up between two
stones black, spikey nuts called tinkara; these are
gathered from the bottom of the river, and the outside
appearance belies what lays hidden beneath, for they are
rather good eating. About dusk, Sumud Shah's shop came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
in sight, and having climbed up the steep stairs into his
showroom, which overlooked the river with its many opened
windows, I was surrounded and made much of by numerous
Sumuds, each of them inquiring amongst other things
whether I carried any banknotes, and if so, whether they
might take care of them for me. Soon afterwards they
produced dinner, composed of about a dozen plates holding
different coloured messes. Fortunately Malik came to my
assistance and brought a mutton bone, and certainly saved
me from an illness. I was glad to escape from so much
civility and hospitality and descend the stairs again and
wend my way to my bedroom, which was airy enough,
for three sides could only be described as windows of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
perforated wood, whilst the fourth held two doors and no
wall.

<p>
The first thing I learnt here was that, if I wanted breakfast
at 8.30, it must be ordered for 6 o'clock, which lesson
saved me a vast amount of trouble and impatience in doing
all other business in Srinagar. My second lesson learnt was
to believe nobody, however sincere they might appear to
be, for these vendors are for ever plotting and scheming
against one another for the sake of gaining the merest
trifle, and many of them, who are seemingly bosom friends,
are in reality the most unscrupulous enemies, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
My time was spent in bargaining and purchasing goods
from men of this description.
</p>

<p>
It was our intention here to have collected, if possible,
some good mules and ponies for transport, and send them
up to Leh, which would be our starting-point. But the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
route was at this time of the year impassable by reason of
heavy falls of snow. All our transport, therefore, had to be
bought in Leh itself. There was plenty to do at Srinagar,
nevertheless, in fitting out the expedition in other ways, and
in endeavouring to pick up some muleteers, as it is not
always easy to pick up good men at Leh to accompany one
on a trip of this description.
</p>

<p>
One day I visited the Tibetan serai which lies a little
lower down the river, to see whether I could get some
Yarkandi saddles for our mules, although it seemed rather
ridiculous to purchase these before the animals. I was
under the wrong impression that they were not obtainable
in Leh. They are made of coarse grass or reeds, covered
with sacking, with soft munnah over the part that rests on
the animal's neck and shoulder, costing from eight to ten
rupees each when complete. They have the advantage over
the wooden saddle, as mules can roll with these on their
backs, and they are, besides, easily repaired, and can have
holes cut into them, or otherwise shaped, so as to relieve
any pressure on the tender part of a sore back.
</p>

<p>
Whilst engaged in getting these saddles mended up, I fell
in with a man called Tokhta, who was clever at shoeing, and
as he seemed willing to come with me I at once engaged him.
He was a Yarkandi man, and had travelled in Turkistan.

<p>
It is a great saving of time and trouble on the march to
have loads so arranged that they can be easily loaded and
unloaded. Most of the things were therefore placed into
yakdans, which are light boxes about 2 ft. × 1 ft. 3 in. ×
1 ft., but can be made to order in other sizes. They are
covered with leather, and fitted on the outside with a pair
of buckles and stout leather straps. Our beds, too, were
composed of yakdans, with two iron sockets in each, to
hold two iron rings. Into these were placed the two
bamboo poles that held the bed. These yakdans can be
bought cheaper, stronger, and lighter at Peshawar. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
also bought 120 sets of shoes with 1,000 spare nails,
and shoeing tools for the mules and ponies, and for
our followers four maunds of rice (a maund equals about
eighty pounds), a maund of dal, thirty pounds of tea, salt,
pepper, curry powder, and hot spices. In the shape of
presents we bought watches, pistols, knives, rings, and some
saffron which is made from the dried stigmas of the <i>Crocus
sativus</i>, and is highly esteemed as a dye by the Tibetans,
especially by the Lamas. A few days later, Malcolm joined
me, bringing his share of stores, etc., and together we
bought the warmest clothing we could find, underclothing
of lambs' wool, thick woollen socks, double soled and heeled,
thick puttoo suits, fur-lined caps and cloaks, and fur-lined
sleeping bags. We wore the regulation infantry ammunition
boots. For shelter we bought five tents, all double twill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
lined. Two of these were for ourselves, one for our cook
and servant, one for our sub-surveyor, and one for the muleteers.
These were small and light, and the whole of them
would not have equalled more than a mule load. I have
seen some tents lined with warm cloth such as puttoo,
but this is not so effective in keeping out a keen wind as
the closer-woven twill. We found iron pegs answered our
purpose, excepting when the ground was too sandy; on these
occasions we used to tie the ropes to one of the handles of
an ammunition box or yakdan.

<p>
One morning, in the midst of making these preparations,
there was a sudden rush and hullaballoo, for a fire had broken
out in some adjacent buildings, and I was invited by many
excited vendors to go and visit the scene. The police
station was in flames, and thousands of natives were engaged
in passing up from hand to hand chatties or small earthenware
pots from the rivers edge, whilst the bhisties or water
carriers were running madly about in every direction with
their skins full of water. The police, who had lost their
wits, were idle onlookers, but standing on a brick wall forty
feet high was a fine muscular man wielding a massive beam,
with which he was beating the roof of the burning building,
with what object it was impossible to say. I was nevertheless
struck by his courage, and inquired who this hero
might be, and felt somewhat anxious for his safety; but
when they told me he was my dhobie, or laundress, my
fear for him was lost in the greater anxiety for my clothes
which he had only that very morning received, and I at
once took steps to get him to a safer footing, and left the
fire to burn out as it pleased. With Malcolm came one
Shahzad Mir, Duffadar, 11th Bengal Lancers, a man who had
travelled before with Captain Younghusband, and who had
done work on the Pamir Commission. He was a great
addition to our party, chiefly as a sub-surveyor, and was
keen on the job. Through him I was enabled to pick up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
another man called Shukr Ali, who had also been with
Captain Younghusband. He was a tall, dark fellow of cheery
countenance, and was anxious to make a little money to
support his family living somewhere in Ladakh.

</div>

<p>
During all this time we received every kind of assistance
from the Resident, Captain Trench, who presented us with
a huge watch-dog called Tippoo. Tippoo unfortunately had
to be chained up day and night, for when allowed to go
loose he invariably seized on the first native who came in
his way. In consequence of this imprisonment he quickly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
became footsore when compelled to march, and took up a
new home with the first Nomads we came across.
</p>

<p>
On April 5th Malcolm left me at Srinagar to complete
the arrangements and to wait for the passport, about which
there had been so serious a hitch that it seemed doubtful
whether we should be able to start on our journey at all.
He left with a small flotilla of three boats to carry some
fifty coolie loads of luggage, together with Shahzad Mir and
Tokhta, who bade many farewells, mingled with callings
to their god, to the large crowd of friends gathered on
the shore to see the start. It was calculated that on the
following day they would reach the village of Gunderbul,
lower down the river, and from thence collect coolies and
ponies and make their way to Leh, the capital of Ladakh,
and the starting-point of our expedition.

CHAPTER II.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ20">
BALTAL—LEH—I REJOIN MALCOLM—THE CHINESE PASSPORT
ARRIVES.
</p>

<p>
Five days after Malcolm's departure, that is, on the 10th
April, news reached me that the passport would shortly be
forwarded; upon this I at once embarked with the intention
of reaching Leh as soon as possible after him. All things
had to be settled up before leaving, and Shukr Ali was
installed as cook for the journey instead of Malik, who
had declined to go but had produced his bill. Amongst the
items mentioned in it was an iron brush, which at first was
a puzzler, but after all it turned out to be not such a bad
name to designate a "rasp." His last request was that I
might give him some more backshish, for he said he had
not even made a single pie out of the numerous articles he
had bought for us! The following morning, awaking in
the boat, I found we had arrived at Manasbal, where three
ponies and ten coolies sufficed to carry the remainder of
our luggage, and we were soon wending our way up the
glorious Sind valley. The morning was still and close,
with small light clouds resting on the hills, while a fine
haze enveloped all which might have augured a bright
summer's day or the reverse. After fourteen miles Kangan
was reached, where our transport was changed for seven
fresh ponies, and the village of Goond, another fourteen
miles, that same evening soon after dark. Although no
provisions were procurable at that time, I found shelter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
under a shed wherein to put up my bed, but sleep was a
failure, as my two dogs Tippoo and Ruby saw or imagined
they saw a stranger every moment and barked accordingly.
Rain poured all the next day, so that I could not push on
further than to Gagangir, and was glad to find a house there
made of mud and wood to rest in. It would have been very
hard for the coolies to have toiled further that day, as the
road for the next six miles led through deep snow, where,
too, avalanches were feared from the mountains which
rose precipitously from either bank of the stream we should
have to follow. I therefore made the best of a halt, and
having purchased a sheep for two rupees and a hen for
seven annas, made a royal repast. The next day, after
a wet march, we reached the region of snow, and put up at
a small hut at Sonamerg. This place, although consisting
of only a few small wooden huts, nevertheless boasts of a
state telegraph and post-office. From here the road was
deep in snow, upon which locomotion became more difficult
every hour. I stopped for the night at a place called Baltal,
well known to the many readers of Knight's interesting book,
"Where Three Empires Meet." Here I found that two
officers had taken up their abode, having pitched their tents
inside one of the stone and wooden buildings, the one of
course which admitted least snow and water. There they
were seated, with big boots, ulsters, and umbrellas, and had
been practically in this position for the last three days, and in
every likelihood would remain there for a good many more;
worse than that, it was probable that I should be added
to the party. I did not envy them when they boasted
that they were the oldest inhabitants of the place. The
coolies lay together for the sake of warmth around small
fires beside the buildings, having to take turns to sally
forth and collect the wood.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Baltal lies at the foot of the Zoji La pass, and these men
had not any wish to attempt to cross it while the weather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
was stormy, for avalanches at such times are most
dangerous in those parts, and they were warned by the
death, only ten days previously, of two post runners.
There seemed, indeed, small chance of starting on the
morrow as I sat down to enjoy a much appreciated dinner
given me by these two old inhabitants. As I retired for the
night we were, therefore, surprised and rejoiced at seeing
once again some stars, and still more did we rejoice when,
at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on a perfectly clear, still morning, so refreshing
after the last few days of storm and darkness, the three
of us, leading the caravan and followed by some sixty
coolies, began the ascent of the pass. It was certainly
hard work for these poor fellows, who, with a load of some
fifty or sixty pounds, had to climb over the masses of snow,
the result of the recent avalanches, and make a road for
themselves, when, as often as not, at each step they sank
up to their waists, all, too, for the small prize of four annas!
Although the journey to the top of the Zoji La was only
about two miles, we took three hours to get there. That
day we were twelve and a half hours in marching sixteen
miles to Metaiun, having made a short halt at the small
posting place of Machahoi. At night I found a small hut
eight feet square, but was forced to wait outside in the cold
while my dinner was being cooked, for in this abode there
was no exit for the smoke whatever, and suffocation might
have resulted had I remained inside. From hence we journeyed
on through the snow to Dras, taking again nine
hours to do the fifteen miles. At this important stage,
provisions, fresh coolies, and all manner of things can be
bought, and letters can be had at the post-office if they
have arrived; but on this occasion none had been received
for five days, at the end of which time the news of the
death of the two post runners was corroborated. From
thence fresh coolies were to carry the loads, and the poor
fellows who had done the work for the last five days were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
dismissed to return to their villages in their own time.
This journey, too, they had done most pluckily and cheerily,
over mountains deep in snow and a pass over 11,000 feet
high, amidst almost incessant falling snow or rain, with no
adequate shelter at night time, all for two and a half rupees
apiece! At this small sum, too, they expressed much pitiful
delight, for it was a rupee in excess of their real fare.
</p>

<p class="caption">FIRST SIGNS OF BUDDHISM BEYOND LEH, AT MULBECK.</p>
</div>

<p>
The fresh relay of coolies carried my baggage in two
more days to Kargil, passing through Tashgam, a pretty
little spot with a small plantation of willows, but the
beauty of the place was somewhat marred by the snow
that still lay about. At Kargil there is good accommodation,
and supplies are plentiful; there are, too, some little
nondescript shops. Thenceforth ponies replace coolies for
carrying the baggage, each pony carrying a load of about
150 pounds. From Kargil the road ascends the hills and
leads over rolling ground, while the adjacent hill tops
become rounded, and the general appearance of the country
is somewhat dreary. After twenty miles, the village of
Mulbeck is reached, where one first sees the small monasteries
of the Lamas perched on some pinnacle, and the piles
of flat stones with their sacred writings, called mānés. From
this point the road became heavy, owing to the mud, and
soon after midday we came to the village of Kharbu, where
I learnt that further on the mud was yet deeper and
thicker, and on the rising ground I found the snow even
worse. About five o'clock I arrived at another small
village at the foot of a pass. Here the men demanded
a halt, for they said it would be impossible to cross it
that evening. Despite their earnest entreaties and clasped
hands, I decided to push on. Soon after this darkness
set in, before even we had reached the summit, and a
biting wind, with driving snow, made our progress slow,
so that at one time I almost regretted not having paid
attention to their supplications. Just as we were about to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
begin the descent, one of the baggage ponies completely
gave way and collapsed in the snow. This necessitated a
redistribution of the loads, many moans and groans, and
very nearly resulted in some frost-bites.
</p>

<p>
In darkness we stumbled down the mountain side,
inwardly hoping that no other pony would collapse. As
soon as we had descended low enough to be free from the
clouds of driving sleet, we were helped by the faint light
of the moon, and eventually at a late hour arrived at
Lamayuru. Fatigue and a short night's rest disinclined
the men for another early start, although the march from
this place is perhaps the finest and most pleasant of any.
The road follows a winding stream running merrily between
grand massive cliffs and rocks, till at Khalsi it crosses the
River Indus, where a small native guard is maintained, thence
through Nurla on to Saspul. From here I had resolved to
reach Leh in one day, so instructed my factotum, Shukr Ali,
to urge on the ponies as fast as possible. This he certainly
did with such a will that in four hours we had reached Nimo,
while none of the pony drivers were able to keep pace; consequently
at Nimo the ponies were without masters. Here
we again changed animals, and starting on ahead of the
loaded ones and mounted on a rat of a pony, about sunset
I first gained sight of this redoubtable Leh. The first
conspicuous object was the Lama monastery, and quite
naturally too, for, as usual with Lama monasteries, it was
perched on a hill of commanding position, while Leh
itself, at first appearance, looked small and insignificant.
With my goal in sight, I was not long in finding a way
through the narrow winding paths, past the missionary
quarters, to the rest bungalow, having been twelve days
on the road. Here Malcolm was waiting for me, having
arrived two days previously, and we at once set about
buying our mules and ponies and in collecting our muleteers,
for at present we had only Shukr Ali and Tokhta.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
We were told by every one that at this time of the year it
would be most difficult to buy mules, so we were extremely
fortunate in falling in with a merchant who had lately
arrived from Lhassa, and who was willing to sell us fifteen.
Although they were not in as fat a condition as they
should be at the commencement of a journey, they were
nevertheless hard, and formed the nucleus of our transport.
Besides these, we were only able to pick up seven other
mules, one here and one there, and were compelled to be
satisfied with ponies for the remainder of our transport.
These we found in no way equal to the mules for an expedition
of this kind. If ponies have to be taken, the best are
those which come from the district of Lhassa. Of these we
had two, while the rest were Ladakhis.
</p>

<p class="caption">BRIDGE OVER THE SURV RIVER AT KARGIL, ON THE ROAD TO LEH. BRIDGE ON CANTILEVER PATTERN.</p>
</div>

<p>
In Leh three distinct kinds of mules are obtainable,
namely, Yarkandis, Ladakhis, and Lhassa or Chang Tanis;
of these the former are by far the most taking in appearance,
and are mostly very big, standing 14·2 to 15 hands. They
are, however, unfitted for a long journey when grass is
likely to be scarce, and only a limited quantity of grain can
be carried. The majority of these mules are black in colour.
The Ladakhi mules are mostly brown; they are generally
extremely hardy, able to stand great cold, and to do a lot of
work on inferior food. Unfortunately they are hard to obtain,
as only a very small number are bred, and some are too
small to be much good. The best of all are the Chang
Tanis, bought in Leh; the very fact of their being there
shows that they have been able to perform a long march
with loads on their backs; they require little or no grain,
and are very hardy. Yarkandi merchants, as a rule, give
their mules loads of 200 lbs. to 240 lbs. and about 4 lbs.
of grain daily; the Lhassa merchants put about 160 lbs.
on their backs, and, when grass is plentiful, give no grain.
Altogether we mustered twenty-two mules, costing on an
average 129 rupees each, and seventeen ponies at about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
sixty-one rupees each. All of them we branded on the hind
quarters to guard against any attempt at fraud after the
purchase. In collecting these animals and our men we
were assisted by Lala Bishan Dass, Wazir of Leh. He also
helped us in many other ways, and as he spoke excellent
English, matters were somewhat simplified. Besides the
two men already mentioned, namely, Shukr Ali and Tokhta,
we impressed into our service six other muleteers, four of
them being Argoons, who are really half-castes, arising
from the merchants of Turkestan making short marriages
with the Ladakhi women; also two Ladakhis and one
Yarkandi. Besides these eight men and our sub-surveyor,
Shahzad Mir, we also took as servant a Ladakhi named
Esa Tsareng, whom we simplified into Esau, and refer
to him afterwards by that name. This man had for some
little time listened to the doctrines of the good missionaries
of Leh, but eventually had reverted again to the Buddhist
religion. For all that he proved himself throughout to be
a most faithful servant and a useful and clever man, for he
could read and write the Tibetan characters. We had one
other follower, an Argoon named Lassoo. He was a very
neatly made little man, cheery at all times. Besides being
an excellent cook, he was also a first-rate muleteer, tailor,
barber, carpenter; in fact, there was hardly any capacity in
which he did not shine.

</div>

<p>
The muleteers soon gave evidence of what sort of men
we had to deal with. They were an avaricious lot of fellows,
and in a body refused to come with us under twenty rupees
a month each, and this amount in actual wages we were
unwilling to give, for we learnt that former travellers had
paid men of this description fifteen rupees, and we were
anxious not to be accused by those who might come after
us of "raising the price." Promises of high backshish to
all good workers carried no weight with such men, till at last
we dismissed the whole crowd of them. At this stage of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
our preparations the chances of our ever starting at all
looked decidedly black—we had no men and we had no
passport—still more so when we were informed that there
were no other men in Leh who would go with us. Being
thus cornered and time most precious, we were in the end
most reluctantly obliged to take them at their own price,
and having discovered in other ways the class of men we
had to deal with, we inwardly reflected that the only way
to meet with success would be to humour them in all they
wanted, and we foresaw that if we acted otherwise no
headway would be made. We also agreed to give them per
diem two pounds of flour, rice, or parched ground barley,
one chitak (equal to two ounces) of butter carried in skins,
one-fifth of a chitak (equal to one tola) of tea, besides the
curry powder, spices, salt, and pepper already mentioned,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
and meat when procurable. We also gave them warm
clothes and boots, money to buy more, and cooking utensils.
We took in all for our ten men and Shahzad Mir nine
maunds of flour, four of barley, four of rice, one of dal,
sufficient, providing there was no robbery, to last them
nearly four and a half months. Having so far bought our
animals and enlisted our men, we at once set to work to
fit out all these animals, so as to be able to carry the
supplies. The twelve smallest mules were provided with
wooden saddles, while the remainder wore the palans; to
each mule were three ropes, two for tying on the load and
one spare. Each mule, too, was provided with headstall,
nosebag, and picketing rope. To equip each animal in
this way cost us about ten rupees a-piece. As regards food
for our animals, we made sufficient bags to carry eighteen
maunds of grain and twenty-eight maunds of bhoussa, or
chopped straw, both of which we should be able to buy
some marches out of Leh, and also at Shushal on the
Pangong Lake, which we were told would be the last point
where we could obtain supplies. We reckoned that on an
average each animal would carry 200 pounds. Of course,
some of the mules were equal to nearly 300 pounds, whilst
it would have been unwise to put more than 150 pounds
on some of the ponies. Thus engaged, we continued to buy
our goods and superintend the work and preparations, still
anxious in regard to our passport, which had not yet arrived.
Amongst other things, we had to see to the cold shoeing of
our ponies and mules. On the 27th April everything was
in readiness to start, and we decided to send forward our
caravan on the morrow slowly with easy stages under the
command of Shahzad Mir as far as Shushal, twelve days'
march from Leh, whilst we ourselves would wait a few more
days for the passport, and follow afterwards on hired transport,
making two or three marches a day. On the evening
before their departure, it was arranged that a nautch should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
be given in the rest bungalow compound, to which entertainment
we were not only invited to come, but were also
requested to subscribe and provide refreshment for the performers
in the shape of spirits; it ended in our giving the
show and their coming to it. In front of the bungalow was
a small green, and in the centre of this a pile of bricks was
erected to hold a number of burning logs; on one side and
a few yards from this, seats were placed for ourselves, with
men standing with lighted torches on either hand of us;
opposite us were the local musicians—would that they
had been placed at a greater distance off! On the two
flanks, the inhabitants of Leh arranged themselves in
several rows with the front ones sitting. Directly on our
left was the well-nourished Munshi Palgez, master of the
ceremonies, who, squatting on the ground with a low bench
in front of him to hold the refreshments, superintended the
distribution of the chang, the meat, and the chupatties.
</p>

<p>
The show commenced with half a dozen women, dressed
in gay finery and bangles, moving in slow time around the
fire, keeping pace together in the varied waving of their
arms and swaying of their bodies. After this, each man
in turn came forward and displayed his own special dance;
some were of gentle mood, whilst others were frantic in
their actions, and apparently dangerous with a flashing
sword. The real fun was only reached when one of our
own retainers, named Usman, doubtless bent upon celebrating
his last evening at Leh, began his wild and lively
dance. In the midst of his performance, suddenly stooping
down, he seized the large pot of chang from under the very
nose of the stout and all-important Palgez, who, having
enjoyed every luxury of life without interruption for many
years, was very nearly ending his days on the spot from
mere fright at this piece of uproarious conduct. Yet Usman,
not satisfied with this mirthful deed, began to dance more
wildly than ever, swinging the well-filled pot at arm's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
length around his head, besprinkling all the onlookers with
the intoxicating liquid, till finally, being tackled by some
stout men from the crowd, he was thrown heavily to the
ground, and disarmed of his dangerous weapons. After
this unexpected burst we retired, leaving the entertainment
to wear itself out.
</p>

<p class="caption">CHINESE PASSPORT, ONE AND A HALF FEET SQUARE.</p>
</div>

<p>
On the morrow, the day fixed upon for the departure
of our caravan, several delays occurred; some small
item was always found wanting by these dilatory men.
So anxious were they to delay their departure till another
day, that it was nearly 3 o'clock before we could give
the signal to open the gates of the serai and let out
the animals, where they had been fattening since we
had bought them. Thereupon there was a mighty rush,
and on reaching the main thoroughfare of the bazaar,
where crowds of inhabitants had gathered to view the
departure, terrible confusion ensued. Some discarded their
loads altogether, others rushed madly into any open door
or alley that came in sight, and as they were collected,
loaded, and driven on again, the crowd grew thicker and
noisier. Soon after passing through the bazaar, the road
makes a sharp descent, enough to baffle any further following
of the crowd, nor were the sorrowing relatives of the
men inclined at this spot to accompany them any longer.
Here our muleteers bade a fond farewell, little suspecting
that this in reality would be the very last for some of them,
while a few of the more generous-hearted cast small change
to the young fry. We ourselves, after riding with them
till more steadiness prevailed, turned our ponies' heads
again to Leh. After so much confusion, arranging, bartering,
and arguing, we lived in peace and quiet for the
next few days, amusing ourselves in taking heights and
latitudes, and enjoying the hospitality of the good missionaries,
our only excitement being the arrival of the
post, with the chance of its bringing our passport. On
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
the 4th May, passport or no passport, our patience had
ended, and we resolved to start, for it was not desirable
that our caravan should remain many days in an idle state
at Shushal. We had no confidence in our men, and felt
there was nothing like humouring them in all their wants,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
but at the same time in giving them no time to think of
forming and carrying out any plot that might upset our
arrangements and intentions.

<p class="caption">MY RED CHINESE VISITING CARD,

</div>

<p>
We hired six ponies for our remaining baggage, and
ourselves mounted on two
others, equipped with
Government cavalry
saddles, carbine bucket, wallets,
and wooden stirrups,
with poshteen in front and
small suleetah behind, prepared
to leave the bungalow.
We had just been lunching
with Vaughan of the Border
Regiment, and Ward of
the Middlesex, both of whom
had come for shooting; with
them we enjoyed the last
hospitality, and the last
conversation with our own
countrymen, we were to
have until the middle of
next October. "Well,"
they remarked, as we
mounted directly afterwards,
"so you are off to
Pekin!" "Yes," we replied,
"we will start this very
moment, and do our best
to get there," not that we
felt doubtful of our undertaking, for the bracing air, the
pure clear skies, the grand and glorious mountains of
Ladakh, would inspire any man with confidence and self-reliance.
Fortune, too, seemed favourable that day, for at
the same moment the postman entered the gate of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
compound, bringing our Chinese passport and Chinese
visiting cards, the delay of which had cost us all our limited
store of patience. The passport gave us free permission to
travel through the provinces of Kansu, Shansi, and Shensi
to Pekin, and through the New Dominion, at the same
time enjoining all whom we came across to assist us and
put no obstacles in our way. As we passed the kind
missionaries' house, we received a hearty and last farewell,
and entering the bazaar rode through it almost unobserved,
for none knew of the exact time of our departure, and
most of the inhabitants were enjoying repose at that time
of day.

<h2>
CHAPTER III.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ20">
FOLLOWING THE INDUS—EGU—WAITING AT SHUSHAL—A
WARNING.
</p>

<p>
It was a warm afternoon as we descended the hill already
mentioned towards the River Indus. We felt full of spirits
in expectation of the journey that lay before us, for great
is the charm of entering an unknown country in absolute
ignorance of what lies ahead. We thought perhaps we
might be fortunate enough to be about to open up a land rich
in minerals or pasturage, or teeming with game, for none
could tell us what existed over the border land nor who
lived there. We might, too, be instrumental in discovering
a new and easy route into China. All these thoughts
and many others were foremost in our minds, while the
glory of uncertainty and the pleasure of perfect freedom,
added to the success we had met with in overcoming all
the initial preparations, made our hearts light that day.
On the other side of the river we saw the straggling village
of Shushot, and at the time I thought to myself what
miserable wretches the people must be who live there with
no thought of ever going beyond its precincts, such as
could never attempt to make a trip like ours, or even
dream of it.
</p>

<p>
On one side of the river we passed by several chortens
or monuments, and the village of Shey with its ruined fort,
an almost indelible sign of its former importance. This
village straggled on into Tickse, which was to be our first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
halting-place. Throughout this valley we had been travelling,
the young grass was just beginning to bud, and we
fondly imagined the richer grass we expected to find when
we crossed the frontier a few weeks later. In the fields
around Tickse, men and women were busily engaged, but
ceased from their labour to watch and salute us, apparently
glad to see Europeans. On the hills were the houses of the
Lamas. We put up at the rest-house and bought two
maunds of bhoussa for one rupee and filled three of the
bags we had brought with us. We used a patent weighing
machine of our own, which, of course, the men of Tickse
could make neither head nor tail of, nevertheless they
trusted us implicitly, for they said we never cheated, but
remarked that if they had had the weighing machine and
we had been unable to understand it, they would have
done their level best to defraud us of as much as possible.
From Tickse we continued to follow the River Indus, or
Tsang-po-chu, as it is called in these parts, through a large
open plain and still blessed with that fine blue Ladakh
sky. After easy riding for nearly ten miles, we came to
the small village of Chemre. At this spot there is a road
which bends sharply to the left, passing over the Chang La,
La being the Tibetan word for Pass. At this time of the
year, however, the pass was closed, for the snow was deep.
We were therefore compelled to take a more circuitous road
but still following the river.
</p>

<p>
A short distance beyond Chemre is the village of
Maserung on the other and left side of the river, and
almost opposite Chemre itself is the Hemis nullah, famous
for its great yearly festival and still more important
gathering every twelve years. The monastery up this
nullah can be seen from the other side of the river just
after leaving Chemre.
</p>

<p>
About noon we reached the village of Egu. The people
about here and the headmen of the different places we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
came to had received news of our coming, partly from
our imposing caravan having passed through a few days
previously, and also through rumour, which in these
parts travels in a miraculous way, and, being friendly
disposed and anxious to aid us (for they were under the
impression that we were tremendous swells), were awaiting
our arrival headed by the chief man and his attendants,
all ready with their humble salutations. On this particular
occasion my dignity had a great fall, for when we had
approached within twenty yards of this gathering and were
riding up in pomp and circumstance to receive their homage,
my pony put his foot into a hidden hole, sending himself
and rider spinning on their heads.
</p>

<p>
I think this unlucky coincidence somewhat damped our
lordly reputation, for we had great difficulty in getting sufficient
baggage animals after it, and were compelled to take
yak, a slow conveyance even compared to ponies at the
walk. Over the ground we were about to traverse they
never made more than two miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
After another eleven miles, we came to the village of
Sherwos, having about half-way noted the village of Upchi
on the other side of the river, a spot worth knowing to
sportsmen, for it lies at the mouth of the Gya nullah, so
famous for its ovis ammon and burhel shooting. To-day
we saw our first game in the shape of a few wild duck.
</p>

<p>
Anxious to push on from Sherwos, yet unable to get as
far as Lickse that evening, for there were two little bridges
that had to be crossed by daylight over the river, we
determined to make neither of them our halting-place
for the night, but to journey on and bivouac when darkness
stopped us. It was a grand march, for the river here
became very narrow, perhaps only ten yards broad, with a
swift and busy torrent rushing through the gorge, while
almost from the water's edge arose precipitous rocks some
hundreds of feet, the grandeur being magnified by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
uncertain light of the moon. At night-time we made our
bivouac close by the waterside, and found this cleaner than
some of the rest-houses we had of late frequented. From
here we crossed two bridges and reached Lickse after two
and a half miles, and once more re-crossing the river
came to Herma, having come ten miles altogether. Here
we changed our yak for new ones, ponies again being
very scarce. These were the slowest going yak that
ever did work for us. After six miles we passed through
the village of Cunjian, as we were unable to change them
there. We continued our slow march, a very trying one for
these thickly-clad animals. The sun beat down with pitiless
vigour upon the loaded brutes as they struggled up and
down a narrow stony pathway, completely sheltered from
any welcome breeze there might have been. So toilsome
became the march that one poor yak carrying the instruments
was actually slipping, and would have rolled down the rocky
edge to destruction, had he not completely collapsed from
exhaustion in a heap on the very brink. It was some time
after dark before we could find a place called Gya to stop
for the night, having only come eight and a half miles in
six and a half hours. Here was a little cultivation, and
just room to pitch tents, but no village close at hand wherefrom
to get any supplies.
</p>

<p>
From here for seven miles the road is bad, stony, and
hilly, and at this distance the village of Kera lies on the
other bank of the river. One mile further on our yak were
once more replaced by new ones at the village of Yakiki.
On paying the drivers of the last lot of yak, we gave them
eight annas each, that being their correct pay, yet to our
surprise they showed much delight at receiving what was
only due to them. This was probably owing to the fact
that the few sportsmen who go up there for shooting allow
their Kashmiri shikaris to pay these yakmen, and these
latter being of timid and simple nature are afraid to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
complain, and are probably threatened with all sorts of
punishment should they dare to tell the sahib that only
half the money has been given them. After leaving
this place the gorge becomes broader, and the road in
consequence improves.
</p>

<p>
At six and nine miles we passed the villages of Ni and
Keisir, and at the latter place were met by the Lama of
Chumatang. Although this man was of portly mien, and
mounted on a stout pony, he was kind enough to agree to
an exchange of animals. Two miles further on we saw the
village of Tiri on the other bank of the river, and a little
later reached Chumatang. Supplies here were plentiful
enough, and we took up six bags of bhoussa, a sheep, flour,
and milk. The people were simple, kind, and ready to help
us in every way. We had intended to change animals
again, but, as sunset was close at hand, it was arranged
that, to save time in changing the loads, we should drive
on our own yak till darkness, and that the good people of
Chumatang should bring on the animals we were to have
the following morning, as well as some donkeys laden with
wood, and a number of other articles in their own hands.
We grew that evening into a large and mixed rabble; everybody
was carrying or driving something for the two miles
we marched, before halting for the night on a small patch
of grass close to the river.
</p>

<p>
Thus far in our journey we had only seen a few gulls and
some duck, so in hopes of seeing more I shouldered my
gun the following morning. Plenty too, indeed, we saw,
but all of them persisted in flying down the centre of the
river or over the opposite bank, so that shooting them
would have been a waste of birds and ammunition. This
was aggravating, to speak lightly of it, when Malcolm agreed
to fetch any I might shoot, should they fall on the other
bank of the river. A few minutes later over came the
duck again, and one falling midstream was soon carried
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
away, but a second falling on the opposite bank awaited
Malcolm. He, true to his word, was soon swimming in the
icy water to the opposite shore, which he reached without
mishap. He soon seized the duck with the intention of
throwing it across to me, but falling short of his aim, the
duck fell in the water, and was soon floating away after the
first. To plunge a second time into the Indus and swim
across it, at this time of year, and at this height, cannot
easily be described, but Malcolm's frozen state on return
gave me some idea of what he had undergone, all, too,
to merely throw a dead duck into midstream. There was
no compensation in the shape of a good supper for his
swim, but we both agreed, at any rate, that shooting duck
along the banks of the Indus was but a poor kind of
amusement.
</p>

<p>
That morning we reached the little village of Maie,
which did not seem to hold more than half a dozen men.
Although no transport animals were procurable, yet supplies
were plentiful. At this spot there are two roads that branch
off to Shushal, the shorter or left hand one leading over
the mountains. We fancied we could see the pass over
which the road went, and there appeared to be but little
snow there. Yet every one told us the pass was not open,
and we had reluctantly to take the longer one. We came
upon a herd of eight kyang, who are pretty sure heralds
that there is good grass somewhere in the neighbourhood.
They appeared unable to understand what we were, and
allowed us to come within a hundred yards of them.
After making an easy ascent, we saw a few miles off on our
left hand the village of Numa, conspicuously seated on a
rock, quite an important place with its numerous ponies
and yak, and plentiful supplies. We loaded up the yak
first, to send them on ahead of the ponies, for they won't
travel as fast, especially in the middle of the day. It was a
sharpish morning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After going some ten miles the Indus became broad,
resembling a lake, and about here pigeons were fairly
plentiful. We agreed that we could never afford to waste
a single cartridge so early on our journey, and decided to
economise by endeavouring to make every shot do double
execution. A chance quickly presented itself. There were
two pigeons close together on the ground. "Fire away,"
I cried, "now's our time." "I really couldn't," said
Malcolm, "they will be blown to pieces." "Never mind
that," was my encouraging reply, "we shall be able to
collect the bits." Immediately afterwards, off went both
the barrels, and terrible to state, off went both birds too,
safe and sound, only a little bit startled.
</p>

<p>
Seven miles further on we bade farewell to the river,
which flowed away to the right, while our road branched off
to the left, taking us to the black tents of some nomads.
Where there are nomads, good grass will also be found
for the grazing of their large flocks of sheep. We
spent the night close to one of their encampments, and
found them pleasant and hospitable enough, receiving
from them dried apricots, nuts, butter, and milk. These
nomads, too, have a knack of always finding a sheltered
nook with a flowing stream. Although we were on that
night over 14,000 feet high, we did not feel the cold at
all, doubtless because we were well protected on all sides
from any wind.
</p>

<p>
After leaving these people on the 10th May, we crossed
over an easy pass, and then descended to more black
tents, always finding the nomads civil and friendly. A
little before noon we reached Shushal, the final starting-point
of our expedition. Shushal lies back against the
hills, five miles or so from the Pangong Lake, which is
not even in sight. In the serai we found Shahzad Mir,
who thus far had brought our caravan without an accident.
Some of the muleteers were there, too, while the remainder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
were watching over the mules and ponies out grazing in an
adjacent and well-watered valley.

The first thing for us to find out was the shortest and
best way over the frontier. We learnt that the ordinary
route over the Marsemik La into Chang Chenmo was closed
by snow, and would not be open for at least another month
and a half. With the exception of this road and another
one that went to Rudok, nobody knew of any other, or more
correctly speaking, would own that there was another road.
Rudok lies at the south-east corner of the Pangong Lake,
and we knew that at Rudok a large Tibetan guard was
maintained, who jealously guarded the main road to Lhassa,
under the condition that should they allow any foreigners to
pass that way, they would have to pay for the negligence
with the loss of their heads. This year, too, they were more
than ever prepared to oppose any attempt at crossing the
frontier in that direction. This we considered due to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
fact that only the previous year the Littledales, in their
famous expedition, had camped for some days within fifty
miles of the capital. To dream of taking an easier road to
Rudok, and crossing the frontier at that point, was soon
dismissed from our minds. Looking at a map of the country,
the Pangong Lake appears to consist of two lakes joined
together by a narrow strip of water, about half-way on the
road to Rudok. We saw no reason why we should not be
able to find a crossing over this stream, thence on to a
village called Pal, and thus avoid all encounter with the
Rudok men. All the headmen and any other men of
Shushal who had travelled at any time in that direction
were summoned to our presence and questioned about this
road to Pal. For some time all vowed they had never heard
of a place called Pal, but seeing that we were bent upon
going there at all costs, they finally agreed that they had
heard of the spot, but that it was impossible for us to get
there, for the water that joined the two lakes was far too
deep to ever think of crossing. Unwilling to believe any
of their statements at all, we dismissed our servant Esau
with a companion to ride out to this water, some twenty
miles away, and find out whether it was fordable or not.
</p>

<p>
Whilst waiting for this information we laid in our stock
of grain for the trip, buying it at thirty-two pounds for a
rupee, and tied it up into coarse sacking, which we had
made into suleetahs. We also packed our bhoussa into a
smaller compass, and doctored up the few backs of the
animals that had been touched up during the march from
Leh; in fact, saw after every little detail we could think of.
</p>

<p>
That same night, and somewhat to our surprise, Esau
returned with the news that he had been stopped some way
before reaching the water by a body of twenty armed men,
who sent their salaams, begging us not to try and come that
way, for if we did, there would certainly be trouble. They
had already heard of our departure from Leh, and knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
that we were waiting in Shushal, and were prepared to
oppose any attempt we might make to cross the frontier in
that direction. Under these circumstances (there was no
alternative left us), we should have to journey back in a
north-west direction along the shore of the Pangong Lake
to Ludhkong, situated on its north-west extremity, thence
travel eastwards to Niagzu, and so on by hook or crook
across the frontier. We had by this time arranged our
loads, and had fitted and mended the saddles where
required, and were ready in all other respects to leave
Shushal.
</p>

<p>
We gave orders to start for Ludhkong at 7 o'clock on the
morning of the 12th, and, in order to save our own transport
as long as possible, we hired seventeen more yak and
ponies, making a total, with our own, of fifty-five animals.
On the morning above mentioned, the baggage lay outside
the serai in heaps and anyhow. The serai itself
was a small, square yard with rooms built around it. We
had hoped, having placed everything outside where there
was oceans of room, to have arranged the loads systematically.
This, unfortunately, was not in accordance with the
way of doing things amongst our muleteers; but as we felt
there was still a discontented mood prevailing underneath
a smiling surface, we, too, smiled outwardly in return, and
allowed them for the present to do as they chose.
</p>

<p>
Each of the muleteers had under his own charge five
ponies or four mules, and each of them, with the willing
help from the people of Shushal, seized upon whatever
baggage he fancied the most and loaded up his own animals.
Although all this was badly done, it was certainly done
quickly, and we had very soon made a start.

<h2>
CHAPTER IV.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ20">
MUN—LUDHKONG—TOUCHING FRIENDSHIP OF MULE AND
PONY—NIAGZU.
</p>

<p>
The road for the first couple of miles was fairly good over
rising ground when the lake first came into sight, and an
extensive view permitted the taking of several bearings to
distant hills. The lake looked blue, clear, and inviting,
bounded on the further side by a fine range of mountains
running into snow-capped peaks.
</p>

<p>
Besides obtaining a view of the lake, we also saw our
flock of sheep, which had left Shushal the day previously,
and very shortly overtook them. We were surprised and
somewhat disheartened at finding the condition they were
in. Two of them were already being carried in the arms
of the shepherds, which will at once prove that our mutton
was not of the fattest description. The remainder of the
flock were going along so weakly that it seemed doubtful
whether we should see any of them again. This disaster
was a great blow to our commissariat arrangements. We
had at one time even reckoned that our sheep might carry
loads of about fifty or sixty pounds, but finding that
would be impracticable, we decided to drive them along
with us day after day, keeping them as a reserve, only
making use of them when our own supplies began to
run short and game was scarce. But now two of them
were knocked up after going only a couple of miles. At
this time of the year, sheep are naturally in poor condition,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
for they have picked up but scanty feeding during the
winter months.
</p>

<p>
On this morning there was a strong north wind blowing
in our teeth as we rode on ahead of our caravan, and after
five more miles followed the sandy, stony shore of the lake.
</p>

<p>
As we were anxious not to be too far away from our
caravan, we sought a sheltered nook by the edge of the
lake, and, dismounting, allowed our ponies to graze on the
little grass that grew close by, while we ourselves, seizing
the opportunity, pulled out the kettle from our saddle-bags
and soon had the water boiling for our breakfast. The
kettle might as well have remained where it was, for here
we learnt our first lesson in regard to many of the lakes of
these regions, so pleasing to the eye, but deceptive as to
their use. Our tea was so brackish as to defy any attempt
at drinking it.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime our baggage had passed by, so we rode
on over somewhat heavy and stony ground to overtake
them, and before nightfall reached Mun, a small village
with some cultivation around it, forming a kind of oasis
in this stony, sandy country. We found here a good serai
wherein to put our animals for the night, and a room for
ourselves and men. There was no more transport to be
had here, but the usual supplies being plentiful, we gave our
animals two pounds of grain each and as much bhoussa as
they could eat.
</p>

<p>
The following morning, although we were able to better
arrange the loads, yet there was nothing satisfactory about
them. Still favoured with the north wind we continued
along the shore of the lake. Thus far we had found the
water absolutely devoid of life, but after twelve miles we
came to the end of the lake, and found there the only
inhabitants living on it, a few gulls and a single Brahmini
duck. At this spot, too, the place is called Kaba, and there
is another more direct road branching off to the left to Leh.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Three more miles over deepish sand brought us to
Ludhkong, the end of our march. This was the last place
where any kind of supplies could be got. There was no
grain here, but we were able to get plenty of bhoussa, some
milk, sheep, goats, and a limited number of hired yak.
The place consisted of a few stone houses built by the banks
of a small fresh-water stream. Around on all sides were
hills and snow-topped mountains; the land was barren, for
there was no grazing ground at all.
</p>

<p>
The baggage arrived in good time, and we were glad of
the afternoon for overhauling everything, doctoring our
animals, and taking heights. We had, besides, to make
up our minds as to which way we were going next. This
was our great difficulty, and at first we could induce nobody
to show us. We knew passes would have to be crossed,
but as to their height, and as to water, grass, and camping
grounds, we were in total ignorance.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening we learnt that, should we decide to
proceed further, we could only go by one road and in this
case should have to cross two passes, and that we should
find no grass or water until the third day on arrival at
Niagzu. This was certainly gloomy intelligence, and a bad
lookout for our mules and ponies. Here they were about
to go three days without grass or water before even they had
crossed the frontier into Tibet. How could they ever cross
the whole of Tibet and China? It was absolutely cruel to
think of it. In addition to this, our hired animals had only
agreed to come with us as far as Ludhkong. The only
solution out of the difficulty was to persuade the owners of
them to come on further with us, and this they were
unwilling to do, for none of them relished three days without
water and grass. By promise of higher rewards we
finally overcame their scruples, and with the assistance of
the Kadir who, by orders from the Wazir, had come all the
way from Leh to smooth matters for us, we were enabled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
to hire more yak at Ludhkong itself, making a grand total
of thirty-four hired animals. These were to come with us
to Niagzu. As to our sheep, we came to an agreement with
the men of Ludhkong, by which they were to take possession
of our flock of sheep, which were coming on behind us, and
were to fit us out with a fresh flock of sheep and goats,
receiving an adequate remuneration for the bargain.
</p>

<p>
Things now began to look rosier for us. We arranged
to put full loads on these hired animals and allow them
to travel to Niagzu in their own time, while we ourselves,
putting small loads on some of our own animals and none
on others, would journey on in advance and cover the
distance as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
We reckoned that by leaving Ludhkong early one morning
we could reach Niagzu the following evening. There we
knew both grass and water were plentiful, and our own
animals, while awaiting the arrival of the hired ones, would
be fattening up and enjoying a rest. After seeing that all
was ready for an early start the next day, we turned in for
the night with light hearts.
</p>

<p>
On awakening the following morning, the first sight that
greeted our eyes was that of our original hired yak being
driven back in a body the way they had come, without
any one attempting to stop them. It was fortunate we had
woken up in good time that morning, as we were in time
to prevent their straying far. We soon had them back
again, and to prevent further attempt at desertion, at once
set about the loading up of the two lots of transport. In
spite of our instructions and arrangements the previous
night, there was considerable confusion, and with the class
of men we had to deal with, it was unavoidable. All as
usual seize upon the nearest animal to load it up with the
baggage nearest at hand, entirely regardless as to whether
the load is suitable in weight or size to the animal, or
whether it is required to go on with the party in advance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
Until the muleteers were quite under our thumb, it was
impossible to make them do otherwise.
</p>

<p>
We carried a glass lantern to hold a candle, and being
anxious to save it from being broken, it was carried in the
hand by one of the hired yakmen, but as to one of our
own muleteers carrying a lantern for a few miles! why, he
had never done such a contemptible thing in all his life,
and wasn't going to do it now!
</p>

<p>
To avoid the chance of our hired transport making a
second attempt to turn back, we left Shahzad Mir and
Esau to bring them on, as well as our two most reliable
muleteers, Bakr Hadji and Shukr Ali, and after saying
good-bye to the Kadir who had done so much good service
for us, and to the kind people of Ludhkong, we started on
our waterless march.
</p>

<p>
We soon took a turning half-right, over some good grazing
land, and then began an easy ascent of the Porandu Pass
for about five miles. When we had nearly reached the
summit, we stopped to boil our kettle with some snow at
hand, and to have our breakfast. Below us we could see
first of all our own mules and ponies, while right away in
the distance our glasses showed us our flock of sheep and
goats and our hired yak, and Shahzad Mir with the man
carrying the plane table.
</p>

<p>
It was not encouraging, after having crossed this pass,
to find the road bending still more round to the right,
following the direction of the shore of the Pangong Lake,
and we calculated that if we continued to zigzag in the way
we had done since leaving Leh, we should stand a chance
of reaching China in two or three years' time.
</p>

<p>
Our muleteers manifested anything but a willing spirit.
As we were riding on ahead, we were annoyed to find the
caravan had halted some way back, of their own accord,
and from their general demeanour we concluded they were
contemplating whether the journey they were about to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
launch forth on was really good enough or not. We, too,
halted; this seemed to be a turning-point in their plans, for
they soon began to move on again.
</p>

<p>
As we ascended the stony nullah, sleet began to fall,
encouraging the darkness before its due time, and compelling
us to take the best shelter we could find for the
night. Close by we found a suitable place—a sudden dip
in the nullah bordered by heavy overhanging rocks, with a
fair stretch of level ground at their foot. Here we drove
four stout pegs into the ground, with strong ropes fastened
to them, making two parallel lines; to one of these lines
we picketed the mules, and to the other the ponies, with
the exception of a certain black mule and a certain white
pony. This couple had lived together practically for all
their lives; in fact, at the time when we were buying our
transport in Leh, we had to be satisfied with taking both of
them or none at all, for the merchant who owned them was
as fond of them as they were of one another, and rather
than see them separated he would lose the chance of
making his profit on one of them.
</p>

<p>
This remarkable pair also found a warm spot in our
hearts, and we did all we could to keep the white pony
in health and strength. They always marched together,
grazed together, and were never apart. On one occasion
when the pony was showing signs of weakness, we decided
to ride it, for by dint of walking a good deal and stopping
two or three times during the march, in grassy spots, we
managed to save our riding ponies considerably, and, we
thought, the black mule would manage without his friend
for a few hours; but nothing of the sort—as soon as we rode
away with the white pony, immediately after him came the
black mule, load and all. We felt more convinced than
ever that should the white pony die at any time from
exhaustion, his faithful friend would soon follow after him;
this doubled our anxiety to keep up the strength of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
white pony, for he was in no way equal to the black mule.
To tell now of the fate of this dear old couple would,
perhaps, be anticipating events.
</p>

<p>
Near our camp there was not a vestige of grass, so we
had to fall back upon our limited supply of bhoussa and
grain. Of course the mules and ponies had to go waterless,
although we were able to collect sufficient snow for the use
of our men and ourselves.
</p>

<p>
We had already turned to our left again, and had ceased
to follow the Pangong Lake, but had continued to make a
long ascent. On leaving our encampment by the rocks, up,
up we went; a blinding sleet blew in our faces, making it
hard to see more than a few yards. At the top of this pass,
which was called the Ann Pass, sickness from the unaccustomed
height in no way sweetened the temper of some of our
men, and we found no pleasure attached to the operation
of finding out the height of this pass with the hypsometer,
with a temperature just about freezing-point. We hurried
down the other side of this comfortless pass, and for the
rest of the day marched along a rocky, stony pathway,
amidst a continuous snowstorm, when suddenly, on a bend
to our left, the whole aspect was entirely changed. The
heavy clouds gave way to a warm and genial sun. Thick
brushwood and green grass replaced the sharply-angled
rocks and those countless loose stones that lay about everywhere,
as though they were a bore to themselves and to all
others. A clear stream, too, ran merrily through this
pleasant spot. No wonder the kyang and antelope had
chosen this as one of their favourite districts to wander
into, and the hares had grown fat and multiplied.
</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE BORDERS OF TIBET; OUR CAMP AT NIAGZU.</p>
</div>

<p>
At this stage we had come nearly forty-five miles from
Ludhkong, and this was Niagzu, a place well worthy of
note, for it neither lies in Ladakh nor in Tibet. We had
thus reached the border of the land we were anxious to
traverse. Having pitched our camp, we looked forward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
to the morrow with composed feelings. First of all, we
knew our mules and ponies would enjoy a complete day
of rest and freedom, wandering through the fresh green
grass or by the clear, trickling stream. We felt our success
depended in no small measure upon their welfare. We
rejoiced, too, that thus far we had managed by tact to
prevent our men from turning back, and reckoned that,
could we only manage to go a little distance beyond the
frontier, they would be in our hands and not we in theirs.
We had, in truth, overcome what we considered as difficulties
such as made us more sanguine for the future. The
day we waited at Niagzu for the arrival of our hired yak
was an ideal one, when much could be done in rearranging
the loads we had with us for the continuation of the journey.
The numerous hares, too, afforded sport and provender for
ourselves and our men. How anxious they were to hallal
this small game in the orthodox manner, little dreaming
that a few months later hunger would cause all these religious
scruples to be put aside and forgotten for the time being!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
</p>

<p>
While waiting here we experienced our first annoyance
with relation to the straying of animals by night. Although
at Niagzu we enjoyed good shelter, grass, and water, yet on
the following morning few animals were in sight, and it was
midday before they were all recovered. We almost dreaded
to think of what would happen should we chance to halt
where there was no grass, and where we intended marching
early the next day. They would quite naturally wander
during the night to an indefinite distance. Our chain
hobbles, though most effective, and with which we had
been so pleased, were at a discount with our men, for they
hated an innovation, and infinitely preferred a long search
of some miles after a strayed mule to the two minutes' work
necessary to fasten on securely one of our chain hobbles.
</p>

<p>
We learnt from some of the hired yakmen, who had
travelled still further inland to collect salt, that there was
another pass of considerable height to cross over before we
should have journeyed very far east of Niagzu. Such being
the case, it was evident that the trial of crossing a high
pass so early in our expedition without hired assistance
would be most detrimental to the well-being of our transport,
loaded as they would have to be up to the brim. We
determined, therefore, to bring forward every inducement
in persuading some of the owners of the hired yak to lend
us their animals as far as the other side of this pass.
</p>

<p>
The day following our arrival at Niagzu there was no sign
of our baggage at all, but the day after this, about noontime,
our anxiety was relieved at seeing some of the laden
yak just turning the corner to come up the Niagzu valley.
From the higher ground above our tents a fine view down
the whole of the valley was obtained, as well as of the range
of snow mountains far away in the distance. The transport
came in by driblets, as also did the flock of sheep, and
it was quite clear that these latter would not last out for
many more marches.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The day on which our yak arrived chanced to be a Sunday,
so we were glad to be compelled to rest on that day. We
clearly foresaw that in future, Sunday or no Sunday, we
should be forced by circumstances to waste no single day.
This last Sunday of rest was in consequence doubly appreciated,
and it was some months before we were enabled to
enjoy another.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER V.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
MORTALITY AMONG SHEEP—LAKE TREB—THE NAPU LA PASS—SICKNESS
OF BAKR HADJI—RUDOK OFFICIALS COMMAND US
TO RETREAT.
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the 18th May all was hustle and
bustle at Niagzu. First of all we were sending off our
sheep, followed by our hired yak. We had persuaded the
owners to lend us twelve yak and three ponies as far as the
other side of the pass called the Napu La. By sending
these sheep and slow travelling yak ahead, we made a
handicap of the march. We ourselves, after seeing nearly
all the mules and ponies loaded up, followed next, leaving
our own men behind to bring them on. Little did we
dream that these same men, as soon as we had disappeared,
were about to remain where they stood for two hours, idly
waiting with all the animals loaded up and tied together in
groups. Still we knew that just at present we had not
sufficient power over them to rebuke them for their unwarrantable
laziness.
</p>

<p>
Our road all day lay through stony valleys, enlivened by
two cosy nooks called Mitpah Yungmah and Mitpali Conmah,
where bright green grass flourished, and where a clear rivulet
trickled over a sandy bed, sheltered by rocks and steep hills
from the severe winds. At these two small camping grounds
the officials from Rudok sometimes place a detachment of
soldiers to prevent any foreigners from entering the country
from that quarter. Although ignorant of it at the time, we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
discovered afterwards that we were in reality lucky not to
have already met with opposition to our journey.
</p>

<p>
Far snugger than these two spots was the place called
Nurtse, where we halted for the night. From here onwards
our flock of sheep began to give way, and we had to sell
fourteen of them to our yakman for seven rupees. Our
men might have eaten mutton all day long, and yet would
have failed to keep pace with the death of the poor sheep.
</p>

<p>
We passed over a good deal of snow, the remnant of the
winter, yet nothing sufficiently bad to impede us at all.
We saw very little to shoot excepting a few kyang which
were, of course, of no use to us. The kyang or wild ass of
Tibet and Ladakh usually stands about fourteen hands;
he is of a light brown colour, with white throat, belly, and
legs; rather heavy in neck and shoulders, he is, nevertheless,
a graceful mover, and there are few prettier sights
than a herd of them scampering over some wide plain.
Perhaps they have been startled by the unwonted sound
of a rifle; off they go, full gallop. Soon curiosity outweighs
fear, and back they come to have a look at the
intruder. All standing in line they gaze at him from a
hundred yards or so, apparently considering whether he is
really dangerous or not; then, at a word from the leader, they
wheel round and are off again, only to repeat the performance
a few moments later, a performance that has ruined
many a well-planned stalk before now.
</p>

<p>
Our guide, who in his time had been a salt collector, and
knew the lay of the country, proved himself to be invaluable.
Without him, the route we took would have been very hard
indeed to find, and to him we owed the steady progress we
daily made, not that we went at any rapid rate, or as a rule
for any great length of time each day, but we were marching
in the right direction, we were travelling east. By reason,
too, of the assistance we received from the hired yak, we
were able to ride ponies, and it was our wont, after starting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
off our sub-surveyor in front of every one else, to start
ourselves ahead of the caravan, with our cook, Lassoo, likewise
mounted. We carried our rifles and ammunition,
while he carried in his saddlebags our cold breakfast with
some tea leaves and a kettle to boil them in. As soon as
we considered that half the march had been covered, we
would halt by a stream, if there were one, or by a patch
of snow, and boil our water. During these operations the
caravan would catch us up again and march on ahead of
us. In this way we were enabled to keep an eye upon our
men without appearing to do so and thereby raise their
suspicions.
</p>

<p>
On the third day from Niagzu we made our breakfast halt
by the side of a valley close to some white stones. From
this point two more lines of white stones lay at intervals,
separated at an angle of some twenty degrees, and ran right
away across the valley and over the opposite hills. We
were told that this was a gazelle trap laid by the nomads.
As soon as they can contrive to get gazelle into the space
between these two lines, they drive them along between
them. The gazelle being afraid of the stones continue to
be driven on to where the stones meet, where they are easily
captured, and sometimes a big haul is made. Although
we saw plenty of gazelle about here, they were very timid,
and as we had no time to go in for a recognised stalk, we
shot none at this period, nor did we drive any between the
two lines of white stones!
</p>

<p>
On the same evening, after crossing a waterless, stony
plain for several miles, we reached Lake Treb, so famous for
the salt that is taken away from its neighbourhood and
carried into Ladakh. Salt, in fact, is collected from any spot
within a hundred miles of Ladakh wherever it can be found.
We had been marching twelve hours upon arrival at this
lake, and it was already dark. Our chances of finding fresh
water were very small, for our guide informed us that there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
was none to be had till we reached the other side of the
lake, another four miles. Certainly there was no water
running into the lake from this side, and the guide's statement
would have been correct, had we not luckily found
two small patches of snow and a little grazing close by.
</p>

<p>
Marching after sunset is without doubt a mistake, for
when a halt is made the animals are unloaded carelessly
and the loads are thrown about in any fashion; the men
become tired and short-tempered, and should there be no
moon, there is necessarily much delay in searching for the
things that are required, especially when candles are at a
minimum. The animals' grain is wasted as well as the
men's rations, tents won't pitch, the water won't boil,
animals stray, and everybody is blaming some one else.
</p>

<p>
All such petty annoyances, however, are very soon forgotten
again, when, after a sharp frosty night, a glorious
morning like that we experienced at Lake Treb announces
the commencement of another day. Everything, even the
crystallised salt, sparkled in those first brilliant rays, nor
was there the remotest breath of wind; all was perfect
stillness.
</p>

<p>
Far away south of us lay a towering range of snow
peaks. Their distance seemed to increase their overpowering
grandeur and one could with difficulty cease to gaze
at each outline of this pure white magnificence. To east
and north of us lay Lake Treb, backed by more ranges of
mountains. Even Lake Treb itself, which on a dull day
would have probably produced a suicidal despondency in
the gayest of hearts, seemed to throw aside its natural
gloom and rejoice like its grander neighbours at the cheer
and brightness of the sun's first rays.
</p>

<p>
We were almost tempted to try a swim in the salt water,
but on close examination we found the shore sloped down
in terraces to the water's edge, where it became soft and
treacherous. All this distinctly showed that the size of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
lake must have been for many years gradually decreasing,
and one is led to believe that such is the case in regard to
most salt lakes in Tibet. The water, we were surprised
to find, was not nearly so brackish as the surroundings
would have induced one to believe. The only life we saw
about it were a few Brahmini ducks and a couple of geese,
which latter did not settle on the lake.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">CROSSING THE NAPU LA (18,500 FEET HIGH).</p>
</div>

<p>
Throughout Tibet we never saw any kind of game on any
salt lake, with the exception of the Brahminis. At the east
side of the lake lies the foot of the Napu La (pass).
</p>

<p>
All the way, a track leads up a narrow, stony, and rocky
gorge, an almost impossible road after a fall of snow. To
have taken our own animals over this pass carrying heavy
loads would have been ruination to our plans, and we more
than ever congratulated ourselves on having engaged the
assistance of these fifteen extra hired animals. During
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
these few days too, a certain amount of grain and bhoussa
had been eaten, so that our mules and ponies on this occasion
were not really heavily laden. At the top of the pass
was the usual pile of stones and sticks which always have
been erected in these regions, to denote that the summit
is reached. The stones had been piled up in the centre of
the col, while a little snow lay on the adjacent heights,
which it connected.
</p>

<p>
A snap shot with the Kodak at some of our poor animals
after a four hours' climb was an opportunity not to be lost,
for the pass was nearly 18,500 feet above the sea level.<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
After descending for a short distance, we saw below us a
fine glacier sloping downwards from north to south; to
have attempted to cross it would have been madness itself.
Around its southern edge we found a narrow and very
steep track, which we followed, and as soon as we had
found some fair grass, lower than and beyond the precincts
of the glacier, we halted for the night, the place
being called Tanjun. Although our own animals had
managed thus early to cross this pass, yet it was not until
the following afternoon that the hired yak arrived.
</p>

<p>
At this stage we began to taste of difficulties and casualties.
First of all our hired transport would go no further,
and henceforth we were entirely dependent upon our own
animals. One of our men, too, Bakr Hadji by name, a
Yarkandi, declared that he could proceed no more. He
lay on his back, and, rolling his eyes, moaned continuously.
We pitied him, for he seemed a fairly decent sort of fellow,
but we had no desire, so early in our trip, to be encumbered
by a sick man. We concluded that he was suffering
from mountain sickness, though all the Argoons came
to us protesting that Bakr Hadji was a Yarkandi, and
like all other Yarkandis had a "chota dil," or in other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
words, was chicken-hearted; they maintained that they
themselves were of very different kidney, and prepared to
follow us wherever we might choose to go. It was, at any
rate, manifest that our men had no intention of turning
back just at present, for with the return of the hired yak-men
an easy opportunity was open to them, and in all
probability it would be their last. Our guide, who had
served us so well, agreed to come along with us one more day.
</p>

<p>
Our road lay through a broad valley, which stretched
away eastwards, with a small stream which took its rise
from the glacier running down its centre. On either side
were small grassy nullahs, suitable spots for encampments.
The guide told us that in two or three days we should find
ourselves amongst men living in a district called Rundore,
and that we should have met men before had not a great
many of them been summoned to strengthen the post at
Rudok. He himself was anxious to turn back before coming
amongst the men of Rundore, for he was convinced that he
would meet with but scant civility for having been the
cause of bringing us that way.
</p>

<p>
After we had marched down the valley for about a dozen
miles, we overtook two nomads, and having supplied them
with some tobacco and other small articles we thought they
would appreciate, we entered into negotiations as to their
willingness to come along with us and show us a road that
ran eastwards, receiving in return for their services food
and money, and some small present, such as a knife. They
became in time ready to accept these proposals, and promised
to show us the way to Mangtza-Tso (or lake) where they
said we should arrive in four or five days. They, however,
feared the Rundore men, and said that they would undoubtedly
stop our progress, should they happen to learn
that we were in their vicinity. Yet they hoped before
meeting with any opposition to take a turning up a certain
valley to the left, and thus escape observation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Throughout this valley we found sand-grouse, kyang, yak,
and the heads of several dead ovis ammon; doubtless some
of the adjacent ranges abounded in game. But at the
present time we were still living on our sheep, nor had we
time to waste in shikar pure and simple, for however fine a
head we might have knocked over, we could never have
dreamed of carrying it with us; besides, we valued each
cartridge, and had no inclination to waste any on a useless
errand.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">OUR THREE RUNDORE GUIDES.</p>
</div>

<p>
It was remarkable that although we were over 16,000 feet
high, above the sea level, yet we were glad to cast aside our
lambskin waistcoats and thickly-lined puttoo coats, and bask
in the sun over our breakfast in our shirt-sleeves, while some
of our men became ill, partly on account of the warm climate
during the day, but chiefly from the excessive amount of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
mutton they ate. At night-time there were well over twenty
degrees of frost.
</p>

<p>
We had not marched very far with our two guides before
they pointed out to us two roads. One road continued
down the valley we were in for a few more miles, and then
turned up to the left hand along another nullah. The
second road led over the hills into the same nullah, cutting
off a corner. We had already discovered that with baggage
animals the longest way round is the shortest way there, or
in other words, that a dozen miles of level marching is
easier for them, and takes less out of them, than half a
dozen miles of steep climbing, which almost invariably did
harm to one or more animals. We therefore sent on the
mules to make the detour, while we ourselves cut across
the hills. Even during this short climb we saw both ovis
ammon and goa, and hitting off the nullah before the arrival
of our caravan, we sat down by the stream that wound its
way to the main one, and, having found some dry droppings,
made our fire and the water boil.
</p>

<p>
As time wore on, we began to grow anxious about our
caravan, and suspected that something adverse must have
happened. We were just about to retrace our steps, when
the leading mules made their appearance round the corner,
and in less than an hour we were once more amongst our
followers. The only deficiency was the absence of the two
guides, who having pointed out this route, had refused to go
any further.
</p>

<p>
Now we saw the folly of having left our caravan even for
that short period, for had we been present we should never
have allowed the guides to leave us in that fashion. We
now began to suspect there was something in the wind, and
decided that our best plan would be to march as far as we
could, and perhaps avoid contact with anybody.
</p>

<p>
Our road unfortunately began to wind too much to our
left, and, not wishing to run the risk of taking our animals
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
in the wrong direction, we called a halt, resolving to
explore further ahead, and find out whether there was
not some other nullah that ran more eastwards, before
launching forth the whole of our caravan along an uncertain
route.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after we had unloaded, and while the animals
were picking up what little grazing they were able to get,
our two guides suddenly reappeared accompanied by several
other men, and, during the evening, others continued to flock
in from Rundore. We invited the headmen to our tent
and endeavoured to persuade them to allow some one to
show us the way to Mangtza-Tso. At first they would not
hear of such a proposal; they denied the existence of any
road, and even hinted at opposing us. Thereupon we
adopted fresh tactics, and quietly told them that if such were
their game we should retrace our steps down the nullah we
were in and march down the main nullah right through the
Rundore district on to Lhassa. This produced a consultation
resulting in their willingness to show us a road that would
take us direct to Mangtza-Tso. Everything was finally
settled agreeably to both sides, and we became friends for
the time being.
</p>

<p>
On their departure from our presence, we were congratulating
ourselves upon the good fortune that continued to
follow us, when to our astonishment some officials from
Rudok rode in in hot haste, and throughout the night and
following morning we constantly heard fresh arrivals, the
rapid jingling of the bells which were hung round the ponies'
necks proclaiming how hurriedly they were riding. It was
dark, and we could hear men's voices from the stream that
ran down the centre of the nullah, while we ourselves had
encamped close to the mountain side. We could see they
had lit some fires and were sitting and standing around
them, occupied in eager conversation. From the light of
the flames we could see their matchlocks standing up against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
one another on the ground. Our hopes, which only a short
time ago had been so sanguine, had now received a severe
blow, and we wondered, yet guessed, what the intentions of
these men might be.
</p>

<p>
In order to solve this mysterious gathering we sent and
invited the chief men to our tent. Two of them were before
very long ushered in by Esau, intelligent-looking fellows
enough and open to hear all we had to say, yet staunch in
their determination to obstruct our further march onwards
up the nullah we were in. Threats, bribes of money and
goods, as well as every other kind of argument, entirely
failed to carry any weight with these Rudok officials, for
they very wisely remarked that "if we allow you to go this
road, we shall for such an act of disobedience undoubtedly
lose our heads, whereas if we stop you we shall receive a
reward." They maintained that they would rather risk being
killed in attempting to oppose us than meet with certain
death for negligence of their work in letting us go through.
Argue as we might, nothing would alter their determination,
namely, that the only road open to us was back by the road
we had come. It was by this time growing late, and the
officials took their leave of us.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the still night we could hear the loud talk
and peals of laughter that rang out from the groups of men
who had bivouacked by the stream.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak we discovered that more men had swollen
the gathering, but nevertheless we began to load up as usual,
and having distributed our sporting rifles and guns amongst
our muleteers, tried to impress upon them the necessity of
having to fight our way through, should we meet with
opposition.
</p>

<p>
A few hundred yards from our encampment, in the
direction in which we were anxious to go, was a stone wall,
built probably as a shelter against the wind, and behind this
the Rundore and Rudok men had taken up a position, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
from their demonstrations it was evident that they did not
intend to let us go by easily.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-089" id="i-089"></a>
<img src="images/i-089.jpg" width="524" height="335" alt="" />
<p class="caption">X WALL BEHIND WHICH THE TIBETANS FORMED UP.</p>
</div>

<p>
As soon as our last mule had been loaded and we had
begun to move towards the wall, our opponents rushed forth
and began to drive our animals back, meeting with little
or no resistance from our faint-hearted followers, who had
no pluck to face superior numbers, whose actions and
feelings were those of fanatics. A loaded revolver pointed
at a few paces distant at the chest of one of them had no
other result than to induce the man to tear aside his
garments, and, showing his bare flesh, point to us to shoot
at it. Such frenzied determination on the part of these
Tibetans proved to us that we should never make any
headway in the desired direction, and that our only chance
of being able to do so would have been to shoot the
most determined of our obstructionists. But inasmuch as
we had not started on the expedition with the remotest
inclination to shoot Tibetans, we stayed our hands. Even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
supposing we had shot some of them, it would have been a
very hazardous step to have risked a serious scrimmage
almost on our very frontier. We also reflected upon the
results of such an affair; not only would it bar any future
travellers from peaceably entering the country from this
direction, but we ourselves would be pestered for many days
to come by an increasing force of Rundore and Rudok men
following in our rear.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, after we had been driven back some distance
and were left alone again, we pitched a fresh camp with the
intention of remaining another day, in hopes that something
or other would turn up in our favour. Perhaps we might
get round these officials after all, or perhaps others of more
influence would in the meantime arrive from Rudok and
allow us to go the way we wanted, when they became convinced
that we had no intention of making an attempt on
Lhassa.
</p>

<p>
Such were our faint hopes as we commenced unloading,
for we dreaded beyond measure the very idea of having to
recross the Napu La a second time, being alone dependent
upon ourselves for doing so.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the morning we tried every means we could
think of to be allowed to march up this nullah, which they
called Kerambutabuk. The officials informed us that no
other Englishmen had ever been there before, and that,
had their men, whose duty it was, been properly on the
look-out, we ought never to have been permitted to come
so far. These officials were quite reasonable and sensible
men, and hoped we would not fight, for they said that
war between the English and Tibetans would result in
consequence.
</p>

<p>
It was a very cold and raw day we spent in this Kerambutabuk
nullah, and most of the time, too, sleet was falling.
The only noise we heard, besides an occasional sudden blast,
was the firing off of the Tibetan matchlocks further up the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
valley, and the tinkling bells on the ponies of fresh arrivals
as they trotted past a few hundred yards from our tents.
There had been so much ringing all day long that, by the
end of the day, quite a small army had been amassed.
</p>

<p>
We told our friends that we wished to go into Turkistan,
but the upshot of all our war meetings ended in our having
to retire by the same way we had come, namely, over the
Napu La, thence northwards to the frontier pass called
Lanak La. They agreed to give us four men to show us
the way as far as Lanak La, but did not see the force
of giving us any help with our transport.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VI.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ30">
OUR RETREAT—CROSSING THE BORDERLAND OF TIBET—A
STRANGE ACCOUCHEMENT—SPORT—PONIES SHOT.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning we commenced our retirement,
followed by a large body of Tibetans, armed with matchlocks
and spears. Most of them were very dirty-looking
little fellows, with long black locks, strongly reminding one
of some of <i>Punch's</i> "Prehistoric Peeps." Their guns, which
we examined, consisted of a long smooth-bore barrel, roughly
fastened on to a stock, with a wooden prong on which to
rest the gun when firing.
</p>

<p>
At the corner of this nullah, where it joined the main
Rundore valley, was a small nomad encampment called
Kerinagar. These people lived in some very dirty and
dilapidated old tents, and possessed a small amount of grain
and a few sheep, but the prices they demanded for them
were high. Close by was a hill called Chotenchenbo, conspicuous
amongst a chain of others. The hill is probably
volcanic, as these nomads informed us that every month
much noise was emitted from the summit, which has so
worked upon their imaginations that they hold it in the
deepest veneration, and on the 15th day of each month
numbers of people from the surrounding district come to
worship and propitiate the spirit of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
We found it heartrending work having to retrace our
steps to the Napu La again, and in order to waste as little
time as possible, and reach new ground, we made long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
marches, testing our animals to the utmost. Certainly there
is a shorter road to Lanak La crossing over the Serai La
and cutting off a corner. But here again we were foiled,
for the men we sent on ahead to discover the possibility
of going that way reported the pass to be deep in snow and
absolutely impassable for ponies and mules. As we marched
along this valley we had more leisure for shikar, as our
surveying, etc., had already been completed. Malcolm
knocked over an antelope, and being alone at the time,
hallaled the animal himself; but our followers, being filled
with pride and mutton, declared that nothing on earth would
induce them to eat the meat, for it had not been hallaled
by one after their own religion. Little did they dream at
the time how, before very long, they would have to change
their minds and be a little less particular. Our four nomad
guides thoroughly enjoyed their frugal feast, as they sat
round a fire of droppings, boiling what meat we gave them
in a small pot, while the bones themselves, after having
scraped off every particle of meat and skin from them, they
broke between two stones, and ate the marrow raw, just
as it was, without any boiling or stewing.
</p>

<p>
This was the last occasion on which we saw anything of
our big dog Tundu. He wasn't going over that Napu La
again, and having had a royal repast over portions of the
slain antelope, he perhaps imagined that if he remained
where he was there would be an equally big meal every
evening. Nearly a year after this desertion of Tundu we
learnt, when we were back in India again, that this dog
had turned up one day at the Residency in Leh, where
Capt. Trench was living, in somewhat reduced condition.
He must have found his way back of his own accord over
three hundred miles. Our little fox terrier bitch Ruby had
no hesitation in re-crossing the Napu La, for nothing on
earth would have induced her to remain with the nomads,
amongst whom she had made her presence most obnoxious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We made a long, toilsome march over the pass again,
down to the entrance of the gorge, close by Lake Treb.
There we found two small pools of fresh water close to our
camp, but no grass whatever, so there was nothing left for
us but to lessen our loads by doling out a pound of grain
all round and three bags of bhoussa.
</p>

<p>
During the recrossing of this pass, there were a few of
the animals who were unable to keep pace with the majority,
necessitating one of the men being left behind to bring them
on. This was the first experience of many such delays we
were about to meet with during the next few months.
</p>

<p>
In this gorge we picked up some curiously-pointed stones,
relics, perhaps, of a bygone age.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the great care we took of our animals when
recrossing the Napu La, they were better off as regards
sore backs and galls than we could have anticipated. Their
chief ailment showed itself in the shoulder, at the point
where the front ends of the saddle terminated. The shoulders
used to swell from the irritation caused, and matter would
form, yet there appeared to be but very little pain attached
to it, and after the swelling had broken, and the place had
healed, the animal never suffered again from the same
cause. When possible, we used to change the palan with
the wooden saddle of another animal, and in some cases
averted the evil altogether. There is no doubt, with properly
padded palans so as to prevent the ends from pressing
against the shoulders, or if the ends themselves were
bevelled off, there would be none of these sore shoulders
at all. Our sore backs up to the present time were
practically nil.
</p>

<p>
As we marched northwards along the eastern shore of
our old friend Lake Treb, shut in on one hand by the
mountains, and on the other by the water, the sun's
morning rays beat down with surprising warmth at this
height of just under 16,000 feet, and finding no fresh water
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
running into the lake we were tempted to test the water
of Treb itself. It turned out to be far less saltish than
that on the other side of the lake, and on giving our
ponies and mules free access to the water's edge they
drank the precious liquid eagerly. The four guides informed
us that the nomads frequently bring their ponies
to the lake to drink the water for its medicinal purposes.
It was more than ever a wonder to us to find the water very
nearly fresh, for along the banks there lay a white crust of
saline particles resembling snow, and when the wind blew, a
cloud of this fine white powder was raised, not at all unlike sea
spray. In some places close to the edge was a layer of ice.
</p>

<p>
At nightfall we halted by the northern edge of this lake
by a fresh water spring. Here we found numerous Brahminis
and a few geese, and a fair amount of antelope dwelt
in the hills close by.
</p>

<p>
That evening the wind blew with sufficient force to create
considerable waves in the lake. The water itself was of
dark Prussian blue, its colour being intensified by the background
of snow mountains and the last rays of the setting
sun. This grand sight, together with the clouds of fine
salt, reminded one vividly of the sea itself. Our ponies
and mules were let loose all the night long, but as no other
grass could be seen, excepting what was close to the spring,
they had no occasion to stray; besides, they had really not
recovered from the effects of the useless double crossing of
the Napu La.
</p>

<p>
We left the lake behind us blessed with another brilliant
morning, the sun again becoming intensely hot about 8 or
9 o'clock. At this time, we used to find this the hottest
hour of the day, before the wind had come; then, with the
rising wind, clouds were very often blown over too, making
the middle of the day sometimes quite chilly. After sunset
again the wind would drop, and every star would shine out
clearly and brightly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This same day, the 29th May, we reached the foot of
the eastern side of the pass, called Lanak La, the very same
pass that Bower had crossed some five years ago, when, first
of explorers in this direction, he made his famous journey
across Tibet, passing a few miles north of Lhassa. We found
fairly good grass growing here, the best, in fact, we had
come across since leaving Niagzu. We decided, therefore,
to stop a day and give our transport a chance to recover
their strength, especially as on that very evening two ponies
and one mule had failed to reach camp. Our casualties
were already beginning in earnest.
</p>

<p>
It was now a full month since the day when our caravan,
under Shahzad Mir, had started from Leh for the Pangong
Lake. They had only traversed 397 miles and were already
beginning to give way, yet we had only just reached the
borderland of Tibet, for Lanak La separates Ladakh from
Tibet, and our journey across this country only commenced
from here. Our store of grain and bhoussa was now
reduced to thirteen maunds of grain and twenty maunds
of bhoussa, while nearly a month's rations of the men
had been consumed. That evening there were twenty-four
degrees of frost, and little Ruby, who during her life
had only felt the severity of an Indian winter, begged for
a warm seat, and was allowed one on my knees beneath
a thick fur-lined coat, while we made our evening repast.
Her appreciation of this comfortable bed she signified by
giving birth to five pups. Three of these little beggars we
soon put out of their misery, and after the first day Ruby
would have nothing to do with the remaining couple. They
were placed in a box well protected from any wind or cold,
placed between some bags of bhoussa on the back of a quiet
mule. Ruby, however, would only condescend to cross
Tibet in this lordly fashion for one day. Her nose was outside
the box all throughout the march, with no consideration
for her two little pups. On the second march she jumped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
out altogether, for she far more enjoyed trotting along by
our sides and putting her nose into every little hole with
the chance of finding shikar.
</p>

<p>
On the morning after our arrival at the foot of Lanak
La, we woke up with the astounding news that our four
nomad guides had deserted, with what object it was difficult
to imagine. We had intended before parting with them
to have given them some slight remuneration, for they had
been willing helpers, and had proved themselves useful to
us in many ways.
</p>

<p>
On leaving this place, we wanted, if possible, to strike off
a route which is called the Polu road, running in a northerly
direction into Turkistan, and after following this road for
a few days to strike due east again.
</p>

<p>
Our men, however, seemed more in favour of crossing
the Lanak La into Ladakh, and finding a way from thence
into Turkistan, and thence across to China. An idea of this
kind we would not entertain for a moment, inasmuch as we
should have at once given up the object of our expedition.
They enumerated the amount of supplies that had already
been consumed, and were anxious to travel as far as
Khotan, and lay in a fresh store before making for China.
We explained to them the distance we were from Khotan,
and the idiocy of adopting such a measure, and reassured
them that as long as we had guns and ammunition there
was no need to fear of ever running short of food, and
even if we did that we could easily strike north again at
any moment, and reach Turkistan in a very short time.
Fortunately, that same day, when Malcolm was away spying
out the country, he shot a yak, and as one of the muleteers
was at hand to hallal the beast, he and his comrades were
enabled to feast on all the tit-bits they fancied to their
heart's content, helping considerably to put them in a better
frame of mind.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak, the man who remained behind with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
mule and two ponies, came into camp with the former,
declaring that the ponies were too weak to go any further.
Not wishing to lose any animals so early in our trip, we
sent back other men with grain, but they too returned,
corroborating what had already been told us by the first
man. As we could not leave them to die slowly in that
cold, bleak land, a poor return for the good service they had
done for us, we sent Shahzad Mir on a stout pony with a
carbine to go and shoot them. His journey was, however,
unnecessary, for he found that both the ponies had already
died.
</p>

<p>
Whenever a mule or pony lagged behind it was our
custom to leave a man or two men with them, as well as
clothing and food for both; but in nine cases out of ten
this arrangement was a waste of labour, for if an animal is
incapable of carrying a load any further, the most satisfactory
and economical way is to shoot the poor brute,
unless there is at one's disposal time to halt for three or
four days by some good grass, giving it a chance of recovering
some of its lost strength. Without being able to do
this, an animal will be driven along for several days carrying
no load, and at the same time, it must be remembered, he
is being fed up with more than his full share of grain, which
the other animals are carrying, in the hope that he will
recover sufficiently to earn his keep. When once they have
given in, and there is no chance of a halt whereby to recoup,
it is false economy to drive them along any further. Yet
we did this over and over again, to our own detriment, for
one forms a great attachment for such patient and long-suffering
animals as our mules and ponies proved themselves
to be.
</p>

<p>
The district of Lanak La is a good shooting-ground for
yak and antelope, and it would well repay a sportsman
shooting in Ladakh to quietly pop over the frontier and
enjoy his sport in secrecy.

<h2>
CHAPTER VII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
A COLD NIGHT—DEATH OF MULE—A FRESH-WATER LAKE—BAD
WEATHER—DEATH OF THE FAVOURITE WHITE PONY—BY
A SALT LAKE—ILLNESS OF TOKHTA—I SEARCH FOR
MISSING ANIMALS.
</p>

<p>
We left our camping ground at Lanak La on Sunday, the
31st May, and failing to find the sign of any track
running northwards, we tried to make out by which route
Bower had gone, but our only map was drawn to such a
very small scale that we could decide on nothing with any
certainty. Riding ahead on our ponies, we found our
easiest way was to continue up the nullah we were in, which
led over an easy pass, from the summit of which we looked
back over the Lanak La.
</p>

<p>
In spite of our extensive views, we could discover no route
running in any direction whatever, and having come so
far, we decided to give up all searching for routes and to
find a way for ourselves, marching due east as much as
possible, and, failing that, north rather than south. Quite
naturally, therefore, we descended the other side of the pass
just the same as any one else would have done, and then we
found a range of mountains north of us, and another range
south of us, compelling us to take to a rather narrow nullah
which eventually debouched in the early afternoon into a
broad valley some miles across, running in an easterly
direction, and bounded north and south by ranges of snow-tipped
hills. Thus the actual finding of our way was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
such a difficult undertaking as one might have expected.
We could see the valley stretching far away to the east, and
calculated that we had some days of clear sailing before us.
</p>

<p>
We trotted on ahead in search of grass and water to halt
by. Straight in front of us, we noticed what we took to be
snow in the middle of the valley, but the nearer we came to
it the farther off it appeared to be, and we were most anxious
to reach that snow, for otherwise we saw no chance of finding
any water. We finally concluded that it was a hopeless job
to try and get there; and as the sun was setting, and a
short distance in front of us we saw some antelope, we knew
there must be some grass close by and probably some water
too. Such proved to be the case; there was a small stretch
of very short growth with two little pools of rain-water, as
good a camping ground as we could have expected to find
that night.
</p>

<p>
A strong wind was blowing from the south-west, enough
to cut us in two, and as the skies clouded over pretty
quickly, we had no chance of taking any observations.
I really felt inwardly thankful that the clouds had
come up so thick, for it is no joke observing stars with
twenty-five degrees of frost and a keen wind. Unless the
clouds absolutely obscure the view and one slips in
between the blankets without attempting observations,
one's conscience feels a prick of guilt.
</p>

<p>
Our mules and ponies must have suffered from the cold
that evening, and seemed to find but little amusement in
nibbling at the short grass. Throughout the night we
heard some of them becoming entangled in the guy ropes
of our tent in their endeavours to find some small amount
of shelter from the blast. And it was a marvellous thing
how the tent managed to stand at all.
</p>

<p>
Despite these and other divers annoyances, we both fell
off to sleep till daybreak, when all seemed clothed in perfect
stillness—the whole atmosphere was calm. It was difficult
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
at first to collect our thoughts and to remember where we
were and what had befallen us. Why was it we could hear
no sign of man or beast? Something unusual must surely
have happened. In another moment we were up and outside
the tent; the wind had completely died away, and
everything and everywhere was covered with a fresh layer
of snow. The men were silent in their tents, some of our
mules lay without moving, others stood with drooping
heads, and, on counting their number, we found that
several were missing. It was not very long before we
found one of these latter; there he lay stretched out close
to our own tent, as dead as dead could be. We felt sad for
the poor brute, for little had we thought whilst we had been
abusing him for fiddling with our guy ropes, that he had
been actually dying from cold or from some other painful
cause. We turned away from the corpse, and tried to forget
our own selfishness.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the sun was just appearing and omened
a fine and warm day, arousing us to the fact that the snow
would soon melt, and if that happened, we should have no
small difficulty in tracking the animals that had strayed.
We at once turned out our men and sent some of them off
on our stoutest ponies to search for the deserters.
</p>

<p>
This morning's disastrous work undoubtedly laid the
seeds of many more deaths to come. As to our own riding
ponies, which had been ridden by the muleteers in the
search, so much was taken out of them that we were only
able to ride them for a very few more days, and ever
afterwards were solely dependent upon our own feet. The
five delinquents were eventually found about five miles
back in the nullah we had come from the previous day,
but they were in so exhausted a condition that one of them
could scarcely drag itself along, let alone take a few pounds'
weight of luggage, in fact, he never reached another camp.
</p>

<p>
Even at this early stage there was no use blinding ourselves
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
to the truth that there were a goodish number of the
animals that could not possibly last out many more days.
Had we been able to find good grass and water together,
our best plan would have been to halt there for a few days;
then, again, it must be remembered that during that period
the men would be eating their rations all the same, and
probably more, without making any onward progress at all.
</p>

<p>
It was almost noon before we were off, and by that time
all the snow, excepting on the tops of the hills, had completely
thawed, for the day was warm and pleasant. Again
we fortunately had easy marching down the valley, and we
went towards the patch of snow we had been so anxious
to reach the previous day, but we never seemed to get
there; the illusion was caused by vapour or steam rising
up from the salt ground and hanging over it like a white
sheet, and when we conjectured we were on the very spot,
we could see nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
After fourteen miles we came to a fresh-water lake completely
frozen over, having been seven hours over the march.
Knowing how deceptive the distance is across such lakes at
this great height, namely, just over 16,000 feet, we decided
to halt where we were; besides, there was fairly good grass,
and a bright moon for observations, but no water for the
mules. The man, too, whom we had left behind to bring
in the exhausted pony, had not turned up, and despite our
discharging our guns pretty frequently, he never reached
camp that night at all. In addition to all this, my own
pony, which had made the march riderless, had some difficulty
in struggling in. We here gave our beasts three bags
of bhoussa, leaving us only thirteen more, and allowed
them to graze till 8 o'clock the following morning. At
that hour the sun had begun to thaw the lake, and on
reaching the further side, after a most slippery walk, we
found a small stream had just commenced to trickle, a
great boon for our beasts.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
</p>

<p>
That same evening, after marching over a stretch of
undulating ground, with a certain amount of grass in some
of the nullahs, frequented, too, by antelope and kyang, we
came to a large salt-water lake. There was but poor grass
around, but a stream of good fresh water. Ahead of us, on
all sides of the lake, the land appeared absolutely barren
and arid, possibly on the southern side there might have
been a little hidden grass; but then, again, had we marched
south, we did not know that we might not meet with
another show of opposition, so stuck to our original plan
of steering north when in doubt. We began at this early
stage to recognise the superiority of the mules over the
ponies, for three of the latter could only just crawl into
camp at a late hour in a very weak condition.
</p>

<p>
Another snowstorm prevented us from making a fresh
start before 11 o'clock, and as the snow had put a stop to
the grazing, poor as it was, we prepared some bhoussa for
our remaining thirty-five animals, yet only thirty-four came
hurrying up for this much appreciated food. There stood
the thirty-fifth, a few hundred yards off, gazing at the
remainder, who had their noses hidden deep into the
chopped straw. Poor brute! he could not reach the spot,
his condition was so weak and impoverished; there he stood,
resembling mostly a bag of bones, a grievous sight for us:
for this was the very white pony who had been such a
great friend of the black mule, and he had struggled hard
for some days to keep up with the caravan. After he had
been shot, we were glad to leave the spot to try and forget
the sad event.
</p>

<p>
By reason of the late snowstorm, the going along the
edge of the lake was heavy in the extreme, so much so
that we lost a small black mule from exhaustion, the only
advantage gained by this disaster being that fewer animals
were left to eat up the grain. The land was barren and
useless to a degree, with no chance of finding any fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
water or grass; the former difficulty was overcome by
collecting some snow, and the latter by being extravagant
with our bhoussa. The ground fell in terraces from the
hills that rose up some distance from the lake, and was
split up by several deep, narrow and harsh nullahs running
into it; nor was there any sign of life, with the exception
of an occasional startled hare.
</p>

<p>
Although there were twenty-four degrees of frost that night,
yet at 6 o'clock in the morning we were eating our breakfast
with comfort in the open, by the edge of the salt lake.
There was not a single ripple on the dark blue water, whose
colour was only rivalled by the magnificent sky, nor was
there a sound excepting the murmurs that came from our
own camp. Although enjoying this peaceful scene for a
few minutes, we were all the time getting most anxious
about our inability to find grass, as another few days of
this kind of marching would have been most disastrous.
As far as we could see, a barren salt land extended due
east, and we were therefore very likely following a regular
zone of salt country, and, to get clear of this belt, it was
advisable to strike north.
</p>

<p>
At the eastern extremity of the lake, we found a nullah
running in that direction. This we followed, a gradual
ascent between two ranges to the top of an easy pass, where
we found a very small stream and fairly good grass. It was
freezing hard by the time our animals reached this spot,
defeating us in our hopes of being able to water them
properly. Three ponies and a mule failed to reach camp,
and we grew more anxious than ever to hit off a suitable
place for a day's halt.
</p>

<p>
It was a grand, hot morning as we commenced the descent
of this pass, so much so that we were somewhat puzzled to
know really what amount of clothes we ought to put on to
suit the extraordinary variety in the temperature. As soon
as we had come down a few hundred feet, we came to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
more hospitable-looking country. Grass grew in some of
the valleys, and water, too, was to be had, while a herd of
antelope close by gave us an easy chance of knocking some
of them over. Early in the afternoon we came to a stretch
of fairly good grazing, and in the sandy nullah close at
hand, a foot or so beneath the surface, flowed unlimited
water. Antelope were plentiful and tame around this spot,
and having fallen into such clover, we agreed to remain
there over the following day.
</p>

<p>
During this necessary halt our time was by no means
wasted. Men and animals had to be doctored up, the
shoeing had to be seen to; there was mending, repairing,
washing, sketching, mapping, and writing to be done; above
all things, we began to overhaul our impedimenta to see if
there were not a few articles we might dispense with. As
it was, we had only been making some nine or ten miles a
day, and even with this care we feared to think of or to
count our losses. At this spot we left a yakdan, with
some horse-shoes and a book or two inside. Whoever may
happen to come this way will find something worth having.
One of our muleteers, too, named Tokhta, was so ill that he
could do no work; he had swollen to an abnormal size, more
resembling a balloon than a human being.
</p>

<p>
Looking ahead of us, it seemed as though a range of
mountains barred our road, and our only chance was to
follow the sandy nullah from whence we had obtained the
water. It was now covered with snow and ice owing to another
storm during the night. On our left hand were some very
heavy craggy-looking rocks, and through them was a very
narrow gorge, only a few yards across, sorely tempting us
to follow it through and see what would be disclosed on the
further side. It almost invited one to enter and explore,
but we feared marching too far north, and followed instead
the nullah we were in, which eventually led to the summit
of a pass. The way was steep and rocky, and the sun so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
powerful that we slung our coats across our arms and
loitered on the top for the breeze and the caravan. Snow
lay there in heaps, a welcome quencher to our thirst. This
was a stiff climb for our caravan, the height of the pass
being nearly 17,000 feet. Having waited till they were
nearly at the top, we began to descend again the other
side.
</p>

<p>
Quite suddenly we seemed to be transplanted into a new
zone, for a cutting snowstorm blew straight in our faces.
We were almost frozen, and any portion of the head we
exposed suffered severely. We looked for some overhanging
rock that would serve for a shelter, but there the cold
became so intense that we preferred to fight the elements
and keep in motion. As soon as we had completed the
descent we found a broad valley stretching east and west,
apparently to eternity. We walked along this, for our
ponies had become too weak for us ever to think of riding
them again, and sought grass and water for making a halt
by. Having found a fairly suitable spot, and waited for
a considerable length of time, we were perplexed to hear
no sign of the caravan. They would have to come thus far,
for until they did they would find no fit place to camp in.
</p>

<p>
Darkness and cold came upon us, and we kept up an
intermittent fusillade till eight o'clock, when a distant shout
in reply revealed to us that they were at length coming.
But alas! although some of the mules walked in fit and
strong, others came in wretchedly weak, and, worst of all,
six animals and three complete loads had been abandoned
altogether.
</p>

<p>
This was a crushing bit of news, coming as it did just
after our day's halt, when we had expected to make such
good headway. The men, too, declared that these six
animals had all died; but we suspected, from their
demeanour and the way they spoke and behaved, that
very likely some of them had been left behind in good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
condition for a reason, namely, that should any of the men
take it into their heads to turn back, they would have the
assistance of one or two stout animals to carry what they
wanted. We knew they had been taking but little care of
the transport, even in the proper adjustment of their loads.
</p>

<p>
In order to satisfy our suspicions, we arranged that
Malcolm should remain in camp, or, better still, shift the
camp a mile or so further on to a better spot, while I should
take a man and go back in search of the mules and ponies
that had been left behind. After a five-mile tramp, we
came to a dead black pony, and another mile further on
found a single mule grazing, to whom we gave some of the
grain we had brought with us. In another nullah close by
was a second dead pony and another mule, which must have
very shortly died had we not hastened on his end with a
revolver. The fifth, a grey mule, we found grazing, apparently
enjoying himself. The sixth, a dun-coloured pony,
we could discover nowhere. He was a useful pony, and had
probably wandered a long way in search of good grass. We
returned triumphant to camp with the grey and black mules,
the latter especially doing good work afterwards for some
weeks to come. Had one of us not gone back we must have
lost the services of two strong mules, which would have been
due solely to the men's laziness, and we could not help
thinking that they, the dun pony, and the three loads of
food, had been temporarily abandoned with the intention
of helping some of the men on a return journey to Ladakh.
My satisfaction was, however, marred on return to camp by
the news that my own riding pony had succumbed in the
night.

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
LAKE LIGHTEN—INTENSE HEAT—AN OLD FIREPLACE—SERIOUS
ACCIDENT THROUGH OVER-HASTE OF MULES TO DRINK—A
COUP D'ŒIL—THE FIRST FLOWER—OUR PET SHEEP—ANOTHER
FRESH-WATER LAKE—A PLEASANT BATH—DEATH
OF ANIMALS AND DEARTH OF GRAIN.
</p>

<p>
We were now reduced to twenty-eight animals, and we
knew our muleteers to be so careless and untrustworthy
a lot, that we resolved that henceforth one of us should
always remain with them and the mules—never, in fact,
let them out of our sight. This would ensure the animals
being properly cared for, and would be a prevention against
the muleteers forming any scheme for desertion. We
decided, too, to make very easy marches. We continued
to see snow mountains in all directions, and somehow or
other managed to steer our way amongst them, either east
or north-east, over valleys and plains or stony nullahs,
but we were most unfortunate as to finding good grass.
It must have been too early in the year, for in many places
it was just beginning to sprout.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the heavy loss to our transport we could only
march some four or five miles the next day, which brought
us to a big fresh-water lake, completely frozen over,
resembling a large white sheet. Here we resolved to
lighten our loads, and left on the ground a number of cartridges,
horse shoes, cooking utensils, clothes, candles, etc.,
besides giving the mules and ponies a feast of forty pounds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
of flour made into bread. Some old pistols, rather heavy
ones, which we had brought with us as presents for natives,
we allowed the men to carry themselves, on the condition
that should we require them as presents we would buy
them back from them, otherwise they might retain them
for ever. Every one, too, carried a certain number of cartridges,
the men doing so under the proviso that we would
lend them a rifle when game was close to camp.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-109" id="i-109"></a>
<img src="images/i-109.jpg" width="541" height="327" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LAKE "LIGHTEN" (WE LIGHTENED OUR LOADS HERE).</p>
</div>

<p>
To celebrate the occasion we christened this lake "Lake
Lighten." The size of this frozen water was deceptive.
Our direction took us over a portion of it which we reckoned
to be about a mile across, but in reality this turned out to
be six miles. On the other side we found good grass, and
in a snug corner a very tiny fresh-water lake, or what we
should call at home a duck-pond. Here were geese, antelope,
and kyang, so we were able to make a substantial
addition to our larder, which at that time was in the same
state as Mother Hubbard's cupboard. This spot, too,
became famous in its way for two events. First, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
here discovered that one of our carbines had been left
behind the day before, and the men were so unwilling that
none would go back to fetch it. To do more than they
were obliged to do was quite against their grain. Secondly,
another mule had to be shot, for he was too weak to rise
and march. The next day another pony met the same
fate, and we began to think our ammunition was more
useful for this purpose than for killing game, which, as
a rule, was scarce. Our march took us another six miles
over the ice, and on the way we narrowly escaped losing
one of the best mules, who dropped his hind legs in a
crack; luckily, he was extricated unhurt, but he might
easily have broken a leg.
</p>

<p>
On the 13th of June we camped by another salt lake.
From the top of a pass we had been rewarded with a very
fine view of it, for the water under a cloudless sky was of
a wonderfully bright blue, backed as it was by massive snow
mountains, but detestable when near for its uselessness.
As we marched along its banks, the heat was intense, the
maximum thermometer registering 105° in the sun, and
although there was no fresh water to be seen, we found
some by digging, though not enough to satisfy our mules,
and on making our tea, its constituency was, to say the least
of it, thick; perhaps Esau's description of it was nearer the
mark, for he said it was like jam. On warm days like this we
were always glad to discard our heavy boots, and coats, while
our little terrier Ruby could only lie and pant for breath.
Such heat in the Chang at a height of between fifteen and
sixteen thousand feet may seem to some people incredible.
Its effect upon our animals was most disastrous, sapping
their strength in no small degree, and on this account we
decided in future to make an earlier march.
</p>

<p>
In this little nullah we found three stones which from
the way they were placed showed that they had been used
for a fireplace, but not at any very recent date, more likely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
two or three years ago. This was the first sign of mankind
since leaving Lanak La, and had probably been made by
some nomads who had wandered in this direction. We
here consumed two more of our remaining three bags of
bhoussa, thereby still more lightening our loads.
</p>

<p>
According to our intention, camp was astir at 3.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
and we were well off before 5 o'clock, and even at that hour
it was so warm that our gloves were not even wanted. It
was a grand morning, and as we faced the glorious rising
sun, we were blinded by its brilliancy and found it most
difficult at first to see precisely where we were going. After
passing into a fairly grassy valley, the home of the kyang,
we descended to a fresh-water lake. At the time when the
caravan was approaching this water, we were both some
distance off, shooting and taking observations, and blamed
ourselves afterwards at having left the muleteers. These
men knew the animals had been short of water lately, yet
took no step to prevent the calamity which naturally occurred
at the sight of a clean fresh-water lake. They, poor brutes,
forgetful of the loads on their backs, with one accord made
a simultaneous rush to satisfy their thirst. The water,
although only two or three feet deep, concealed a treacherous
bottom of several feet of soft mud and as they plunged in
further and deeper, a general collapse ensued, and the mules
and ponies lay in a heap unable to extricate themselves,
with a good chance too of being drowned. Nor did any of
our baggage benefit by the soaking it received. Each animal
as he lay had to be unloaded separately, no easy undertaking,
and then pulled out of the mud on his side by head and tail,
by four or five men. Furthermore the weight of each load
was considerably increased by this disaster, and as the going
along the edge of the water was not of the best, there were
more stragglers than ever into our new camp, two of them not
even getting in at all. Around the lake were several antelope,
while geese and Brahmini ducks were fairly plentiful.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There appeared to be no outlet, and from the nature of
the soil for some distance round the lake, we judged that
its size varied in accordance with the rainfall. From this
lake two routes were open to us, one running in a somewhat
northerly direction through a good, grassy, watered
valley, which we should have liked to have taken; but as
the other route led almost due east, we took it, and
perhaps made a wrong decision, for we came to a dried-up
country, with small salt lakes, and had to dig deep in a dry
river bed for water. The antelope we had slain made its
mark upon the men, for the quantities of meat they ate
made them lazy and late in making a start the next morning.
</p>

<p>
As we moved off at six o'clock, there was a light mist
hanging over the land, with no breath of wind to dissolve it,
a pretty sure sign of a hot day. We began ascending for
some miles, and then dipped into a dry river bed. This
looked a likely place to find water again by digging, and as
fair grass grew around, we decided to halt. We had only
marched seven miles, yet there were stragglers, and four
loads had to be abandoned. This loss we could ill afford,
so agreed to halt another day, when we could send back
some of our stoutest mules and recover the baggage. We
had no fear whatever of a stranger turning up during
the night and running off with some of the goods. As
we intended remaining another day at this spot, it was
indispensable that we should contrive some means for
watering the animals properly. We found water flowing
three or four feet below the surface, but a single hole was
very quickly emptied, and then we had to wait until it had
refilled, so that watering in this kind of way would have
taken half the day. Every one, therefore, was set to work
to dig water-holes. We carried with us a large waterproof
sheet, and having made a trench in the sand, in the shape
of a trough, we spread the sheet over it, and then filled it
up from the various holes. In this way the mules and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
ponies could come and drink as often and as much as they
liked, and they probably would have drunk more than they
did, had not the water been somewhat saltish, with certain
purging qualities. We also set about lessening the loads
again, and many of the articles which we had imagined
before to be absolutely necessary were here discarded. Two
of our five little tents were abandoned, and we took the
opportunity of photographing our last entire camp. Other
things, too, were left, for our animals were dying at an
alarming rate. Out of our original thirty-nine only twenty-one
remained, including the riding pony of Shahzad Mir.
Our own riding days had before this come to an end.
</p>

<p class="caption">17th JUNE. THREE OF OUR TENTS ARE ABANDONED AT THIS SPOT.</p>
</div>

<p>
Yet we had only come 150 miles from Lanak La, but
our hopes of coming across nomads, from whom we might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
either purchase yak or exchange some of our own worn-out
mules, strengthened us in our determination not to entertain
for a moment the idea of turning back. The men, too,
were so confident that we should ere long fall in with
nomads that they became lavish with their rations. Instead
of continuing the practice of doling their allowance out to
them every three or four days, they had latterly been
permitted to have the full run of it, after being made well
aware how long the rations should last if they never
exceeded the amount agreed upon. This plan was instituted
because in spite of all our endeavours to regulate the
consumption of food, yet in the dead of night they would
undo and take out whatever extra they fancied, even when
the foolhardiness of such a procedure was carefully explained
to them. Nevertheless, we reaped one advantage from their
avarice, namely, that the loads grew lighter in a shorter
time than they otherwise would have done. One man,
Mahomed Rahim, annoyed at being upbraided for his
laziness and sulky temperament, threatened to turn back.
This we gave him full permission to do, much to his
astonishment, and on second thoughts he withdrew his
threat, and even our own persuasion would not induce him
to go.
</p>

<p>
During our halt we were able to overhaul all the luggage.
Some of it had suffered from the immersion in the lake,
notably the contents of our dispatch box, for all our papers
inside it had had a thorough soaking, and each one had to
be put under a stone to be dried again, and to save it from
being blown away by the strong wind.
</p>

<p>
About half a mile from our camp was a solitary hill
rising up between eight and nine hundred feet above the
level of the camp. I climbed over the rocks to the
summit of this to spy out the land, and see which would be
the most favourable route to take. South-east of us lay a
fine range of snow mountains, and I reckoned that if we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
could manage to steer just north of these, there would be
no more difficulty about water to annoy us. All the ranges,
large and small, seemed to run east and west, and it struck
me how much more difficult, for this reason, it would be to
traverse Tibet from north to south. Directly south of us,
some sixty or eighty miles off, was another magnificent
snow range with enormous white peaks. Some six or eight
miles south-east was a dark blue salt lake, with two other
smaller ones nestling close to it, and in the nullah immediately
south of us grew grass which, for this country, was
rich. Far away to the north again loomed another mighty
snow range. Our own way eastwards, as far as I could
make out, would take us past a small lake, and then, skirting
round some low hills, turned up a nullah half left, where
there seemed, through my glasses, to be good grass.
</p>

<p>
On account of the heat we delayed our march till early
in the afternoon. During a part of the morning we tested
the skill of our muleteers in rifle shooting. We thought
that, should we come across nomads who showed any
signs of hostility, our men would have more confidence in
their arms, and perhaps would not show the white feather.
None of them could hit an empty bottle at forty yards, so
the confidence in their aim received rather a demoralising
shock.
</p>

<p>
Two days after leaving this camp, we crossed over an easy
pass of some 17,000 feet high, and about the top of this
found a small white butterfly and a yellow flower, the first
we had seen, and it was satisfactory to think that our flower
press had not been carried along all this way for nothing,
for it nearly shared the same fate as other things thrown
away. A few miles further on, we camped in a grassy
nullah, close by some heavy, craggy rocks.
</p>

<p>
Finding the morning again too hot for the mules to
march, we shouldered our rifles and set forth in search of
game, and to try and find out the lay of the country ahead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
We had completely run out of meat and had no wish to slay
our single sheep, which for many days had marched along
with us, the sole survivor of our flock. He had now become
inured to hardships, was never fatigued, and was looked
upon as our very last reserve in case of starvation. Although
we actually found no game, yet we saw tracks of antelope,
kyang, and one or two entire skeletons of yak.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-116.jpg" width="538" height="331" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WE CAMP IN A GRASSY NULLAH.</p>
</div>

<p>
We were rewarded for our tramp in another way, when,
from some high ground, we saw below us a fresh-water lake
with rich grass growing around it, and we wondered why
nomads did not go and live there if they knew of the spot.
We hurried back to camp with the good news, so as to march
to such a paradise as soon as possible, and halt there
another day, to give our animals the opportunity of
thoroughly enjoying the luxurious spot. Poor brutes,
strive as hard as they might, there had been more
casualties amongst them and we were reduced to nineteen,
less than half our original number.
</p>

<p>
On arrival at this lake, we found the centre portion of it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
frozen over. By the edge of the water were a number of
geese; but they might as well have been living in another
country altogether, for they would give us no chance of shooting
them, and we began to meditate the slaughter of our pet
sheep, when, coming over the crest of a grassy rise, we spotted
a herd of antelope. They were certainly timid, but, with a
lucky longish shot, Malcolm knocked one over, saving us
from hunger and our dear old sheep from an unmerited
death. How often we looked at our living mutton with
hungry feelings, it is hard to say, and how often an antelope
just saved him from the slaughter-house would be equally
hard to relate. We admired him, too, for his pluck and
endurance, for he had long outstayed every other member
of the flock. Our affection for him was great, and we even
meditated his triumphal entry into China, and he would
undoubtedly have accomplished it, had not an unforeseen
mishap later on demanded his flesh and blood. Poor beast,
if he had only known how we admired him, he would
willingly have given us a dinner long ago.
</p>

<p>
It was a great treat for all to get good water clear and fresh,
for latterly the water we had been digging up had been
mostly muddy and saltish. We were blessed with a perfect
day for repose, the mules and ponies grazed along the
edge of the lake, sometimes standing up to their fetlocks
in the still water, a day of thorough enjoyment to them.
All their swellings and sores too were doctored up and
the shoeing looked to. Considering what they had undergone,
their backs were in a very satisfactory state. Tents
and clothes were mended and a general clear-up was
organised, so much so that about midday, we and Ruby were
bathing in the lake itself, and although the lake was partly
frozen over with ice, and we were living at a height of nearly
16,000 feet, the water was quite enjoyable, and we could
remain splashing about in it for half an hour, and afterwards
bask naked in the sun. So much pleasure did we derive from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
this bath that we ordered all the men down for tubbing.
They went, certainly, but the amount of washing they
executed would not have been sufficient for some people.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A DAY'S HALT BY A FRESH-WATER LAKE.</p>
</div>

<p>
A climate like this at such a height struck us as truly
marvellous. After seventeen degrees of frost by night, we
found ourselves basking in the open in a temperature of
106 degrees, showing a variation of ninety degrees in the
twenty-four hours. At 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> again, the thermometer registered
as much as forty-eight degrees Fahr. Our route, as
far as we could make out, lay over a large open plain with
but scanty grass, and far off we could see a hill standing
out alone conspicuously, a useful landmark for us to march
on to. Without a distinct feature to make for, the
caravan would very often zigzag down a broad valley and
perhaps cover a mile or two more of ground than was
necessary.
</p>

<p>
We were off before 5 o'clock, with a keen morning air in
our faces, but after a couple of hours the heat became so
unbearable that we would fain have halted. We had,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
however, to march ten miles before we could find a spot at
all suitable, where, too, we had to resort to digging for water.
Around here we shot sand-grouse, excellent food. Owing
to the impossibility of marching with the sun so powerful,
we decided to make two short marches each day, one of
three hours in the very early morning, and the second
during the afternoon. The drawbacks to this method were
the uncertainty of finding grass and water twice in one day,
and the fatigue involved in doubling the work of collecting
the animals and loading and unloading them. But to march
ten miles straight away in one morning as we had just done
would have been suicidal. We reckoned that by making
these two short marches, we should cover rather more
ground each day, about twelve miles.
</p>

<p>
Whilst resting the animals, that they might recover from
the results of the hot morning's march, we sent Esau on in
front to spy out the land, who brought back the favourable
news that lakes and grass were ahead of us, and no
mountains to climb. It was bitterly cold as we moved off
at 4.30, but no doubt a bracing morning for our animals,
but as soon as the sun rose, the heat again made itself unpleasant,
and we were glad to find a suitable camp before
8 o'clock. One of the mules, a big black one, could only
carry his load a few yards, and had to be shot. Although
at the end of the first march we had found a good halting
place in a clean gravel-bedded nullah, with running water
from the snow mountains, and fair grass, yet the second
march ended by moonlight with no grass at all, and two
of the ponies were left behind. Our second attempt at a
double march failed.
</p>

<p>
During the early morning we hit off a rivulet, which,
as we continued to follow it, increased in volume, but on
issuing from the nullah into a large open plain, this rivulet
became a river, some ten yards across, and two feet deep,
and wound away northwards. As our course took us due
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
east, we reluctantly had to leave it, with the hope of meeting
it again further on, and of finding its size still larger, so
that we might be able to map out its course for a considerable
distance. For some time afterwards we could see a
silver streak in the distance, and beyond it an enormous
range of snow mountains.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we left the river and marched east, our route
lay across a sandy gravel plain, and our chances of ever
finding water and grass again seemed very small, when,
fortunately, from one of the hills I climbed, I noticed a
hidden dip in the ground, with grass, and here, as usual,
water was found by digging. The number of our animals
was still decreasing, and the strength of the survivors was
growing weaker and weaker. We had to economise every
cupful of grain, for that was the way we always doled
it out. There were six bags remaining, in all about
480 pounds, and we reckoned that each bag would last
out for eight marching days if we gave to each animal
two cupfuls of grain <i>per diem.</i> There were only sixteen
survivors. One of the mules showed an obstinate and
mutinous frame of mind, for when loaded with his fair
due, he absolutely refused to march; as soon as we gave
him a light load, he trotted along gaily and felt no effects
from the march. He was about the fattest and strongest
mule we had, thereby convincing us that his inability to
carry his proper amount of baggage was a mere sham, and
in order that he should not get the better of us, we gave his
grain to others who did his work, until he saw the folly of
his obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
On viewing the country from a neighbouring hill, I found
that if we marched due east we should meet with obstacles
in the shape of innumerable steep nullahs of red, sandy
soil, but that by marching north-east we should travel over
undulating grassy ground skirting round a small range of
hills. This latter route we decided upon, with the hopes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
of marching due east again before very long. We also
made up our minds to try and find a good camp where we
could halt for two days, so that during that time we could
send off men north and south, with food to last them, in
order to search for signs of people. Even if the men were
not successful in their object, still we reflected that the
animals would be gaining strength and a complete rest
all the while.
</p>

<p>
At 3.45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 23rd June, Camp 36, we were drinking
our cocoa with chupatty in the open, without feeling any
discomfort from the cold, preparatory to marching. We
required neither gloves nor coats, and we almost imagined
we were about to start for an early morning shoot in the
Indian plains. For the next two days we made successful
double marches, inasmuch as there were no transport
disasters. As usual, we dug for water, and found it
brackish for our labours.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the second day, we came to a small
nullah with beautifully green grass, and two tiny pools of
water almost fresh. Imprinted on the moist sandy soil
were marks of kyang, antelope, and yak. Evidently we had
hit upon a favourite drinking resort of game, and accordingly
pitched our tents just out of sight but close to the pools,
expecting to get as much food as we wanted, for it was no
easy matter to keep ourselves supplied in meat. Although
we stopped here a day, the only game that came for his
drink was a cock sand-grouse, who suffered the penalty of
death for his intrusion, while just above the camp was an
old hen, who sat undisturbed upon her nest. We should
have had to be a good deal hungrier than we were before
we could have found it in our hearts to kill her.

<h2>
CHAPTER IX.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ20">
TERRIBLE GUN ACCIDENT—WE SEND OUT SCOUTS.
</p>

<p>
We were still favoured with wonderfully fine weather.
About this time the wind would blow from the east in the
morning, and afterwards from the west, if there were any
wind at all.
</p>

<p>
During our halt, we sent out men to the north and to the
south, to try and find some signs of nomads, while we ourselves
sallied forth in search of game. The total result of
all our exertions was <i>nil</i>. The men who went south spoke
only of a hilly country with grass and no water, and
the northerners reported that after crossing a broad grassy
valley they came to a range of hills, and that on the other
side flowed our lost river, then consisting of a small stream
running south-east in the centre of a very large sandy
nullah; that still further off was another range of hills but
no grass. We could not put much faith in the assertion
of having found our lost river, which must have been still
further north.
</p>

<p>
There is a place marked as a town in our map, called
Barkhalu, which we intended to try and steer for by keeping
as nearly as possible on the line of its exact latitude. From
our present camp we reckoned that it was about a week's
journey off. With such expectations, we endeavoured to
keep up our men's spirits, and to induce them to double
their exertions. It was always a difficult task to get them
up of a morning in time to load the animals for an early
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
start, and upon their doing this our success greatly
depended. In order to make a start at 4.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, the
camp would have to wake up very soon after three, and
unless Malcolm or I awoke, the camp would go slumbering
on till sunrise. But when we knew it depended upon ourselves,
one of us generally managed to wake up in time.
As the men had returned unsuccessful from their search for
people after one day, there was no need to stop two, especially
as all were eager to get on to Barkhalu. At our first halt
for grass and digging operations, the sand-grouse came over
in fair numbers and did well for our breakfast. Ahead of
us a range of hills obscured an extensive view, although
they did not appear of a very formidable nature, differing
from those ranges to our north and south. The very feeling
of not being able to see our onward course made us all the
more eager to surmount the obstacle, peep over the other side,
and see what lay in store for us.
</p>

<p>
On the 27th of June, Camp 39, we marched up the hills
that hid our view and camped near the summit, where the
water was brackish and purging. We inspected our men's
rations, and found there was only sufficient to last them
twenty-five days more, and as to ourselves, our consumption
would have to be curtailed to one pound a day between the
two of us, so as to last out for the same length of time. We
all hoped to reach Barkhalu and there lay in fresh supplies,
and we felt that if we could not find the place, our difficulties
would be hard to overcome. From this summit we made
a very early start at 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I went on ahead, as it was my
turn, finding it fairly plain sailing, considering it was not
yet light. It was my intention to reach some point of
vantage, whence I could get a good view as soon as there
was sufficient light. Below me was an expanse of uneven,
barren, sandy country, and the haze prevented me from
seeing at all far.
</p>

<p>
As I was finding a way over these low mounds, I looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
back, as was my wont, to see how far the caravan had come,
when I noticed that Esau, a long way off, was coming
towards me all alone, but, thinking little of it, I went on
again to another bit of rising ground. There was Esau
still alone, and on using my glasses I saw that he was first
walking, then running; no doubt he wanted me. I waved
my handkerchief and waited. On he came faster than
before, so that when he reached me, he was so breathless
from his exertion and feverish agitation, that it was some
minutes before he could come out with even a single word.
His first utterance was, "Shot—gun." It struck me that
something terrible might have happened; all sorts of things
entered my head, and the worst thought of all—had
Malcolm met with an accident? I made Esau sit down,
and as soon as he had grown calmer, he told me that our
cook, Lassoo, had been carrying a shot gun, and that
Mahomed Rahim had tried to take it from him. Whilst
they were struggling for the loaded weapon, off went the
trigger, and the contents of the cartridge had blown away
the lower half of the face of one of the muleteers, by name
Sulloo, who was marching only a couple of yards off at the
time.
</p>

<p>
I hurried back as fast as possible, only hoping that Esau,
like many other people, had been carried away by his own
imagination, and greatly exaggerated the truth. I thought
it quite possible that the man might have been wounded,
and at first sight that Esau had on the spur of the moment
concluded that half the man's face had been blown away.
I soon met the caravan, still coming along with most of the
men, but their long faces and downcast looks told me too
clearly that there had been some sad mishap. They told
me that Malcolm had remained with Sulloo to doctor him
up and give him brandy, and had sent on the caravan,
with orders to halt at the very first spot where water could
be got. It seemed to me that at the place where we met
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
water could be obtained by digging, so the animals were
at once unloaded and set free.
</p>

<p>
On my way further back to the scene of the disaster I
met Malcolm coming towards me. He explained to me
how the poor man had completely lost the lower half of his
face, and how he had done his best for him in the way of
bandaging and doctoring. It was impossible for him to
walk or ride, so the men took back one of our bamboo beds,
whereon to bring him into camp. Whilst they were away
on this errand, Malcolm and I set to work to dig for water,
the toughest dig we had had, and as the water could be
only taken out by cupfuls it was a very tedious business
before the animals had had sufficient to drink. The water,
too, was very brackish, and almost undrinkable.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Sulloo had been brought in, and we
found the most effective solution in the way of soothing
his pain was cyona and water. The poor fellow was most
plucky over it, and implored to be merely left where he was
to die. His only thought was that somebody owed him
twenty rupees, and he wanted this money to go to his
brother, and not to the woman he had married the day
before he had set out from Leh! And there was no one
else he cared about. We had certainly fallen into a most
distressing fix. We could not help wishing that it might
be so willed that the unfortunate man should die quietly
that same morning. We could then have buried him, and
marched away from the sad calamity to fresh scenes. As
one of our men, Shukr Ali, philosophically remarked, it
would only be his "kismet." Should, on the other hand,
the man live, for all that, it was not in our power to remain
where we were, for in that case the small store of rations
would have soon been eaten up, and when they were gone
there was nothing to follow, as far as we could see, but
starvation. "We must shove on and find people" had
been our daily axiom for some time, and to halt more than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
was absolutely necessary for the strength of the mules would
be entirely fatal. Yet it was our duty, it we possibly could,
to keep the man alive, and we knew it, too. We were in
a most unpleasant situation; whichever course we adopted
was equally hateful to us.
</p>

<p>
After seriously considering the pros and cons, we decided
to remain where we were, Camp 40, for the day, and on
the morrow to strap the man to a pony, with a muleteer
walking on either side to support him. The idea of carrying
him on a stretcher certainly entered our heads, but its
execution was an impossibility.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a very gloomy day, most of the time being
spent in trying to get enough water from the holes we had
dug. The unhappy Sulloo was fed through a small opening,
by holding back his head and pouring down brandy and
water or mutton broth.
</p>

<p>
One sad event seldom comes without a second. As we
had no meat with us, and it was imperative that Sulloo
should have something in the shape of beef-tea, for solid
food could never be his fare again, we had to slay our dear
old sheep and make the soup from his bones and what flesh
there was. We wondered all the time what possible good
we could be doing the man. He would never be able to
eat again, nor even speak, or, as Shukr Ali put it, "What's
the use of troubling about him? <i>Admi kabhi nahin banjaega!</i>
He'll never make a man any more."
</p>

<p>
Our caravan was very depressed as it moved off the next
morning at 4.30, marching for five miles over a most barren,
sandy, and desolate country, when there was some improvement,
and we were able to call a halt, again managing to
get brackish water by digging. Poor Sulloo was brought
into camp later on, and seemed to be doing well, for the
bleeding ceased when he was placed on the ground and
rested from the motion of the pony. He would lie huddled
up in a heap on the pony's back, and if the pony happened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
to take an uneven pace or make a sudden jolt over an
unlevel piece of ground, the jar to the man must have been
almost unbearable. The second march was accomplished,
too, without any casualty to man or beast.
</p>

<p class="caption">OUR MULES BEING WATERED.</p>
</div>

<p>
The following day we had two stragglers, and Sulloo came
in late, for even the two miles an hour was too fast for him.
The land we marched over was remarkable for its various
coloured stones; there were different shades of blue, red,
green, yellow, black, and white, all perhaps indicating the
presence of a multitude of minerals. The fine range of
mountains to the north was still kept in sight, and we
conjectured they must be a part of the Kuen Lun. Towards
evening we came to a sandy nullah at the foot of an easy
pass, and as water was good and plentiful a foot below the
surface, and the animals had had none that day, we halted
and made our drinking trough with the waterproof sheet.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
The wind blew hard and bitterly cold that evening from the
north, and as we had no meat we tried one of Lazenby's
pea-soup squares. These were excellent, and quite equal to
a meal; would that we had brought more of them. After
the strong night wind, we had a perfectly still cloudless
morning as we began the ascent of the pass, whose summit
we reached almost simultaneously with the rising sun.
</p>

<p>
We were sorely in need of meat, and although there was
good grass round and about, yet there was no water visible
above the surface, and this was how we accounted for the
remarkable absence of any game. During the latter part of
the day things improved, for an antelope was shot, but as
none of the men were at hand to hallal the beast the entire
meat fell to our share, so we made the most of our opportunity
by carrying enough to last us for five or six days.
And if we were lucky enough during that time to shoot
another antelope, we promised the men they should have
the whole of it, provided one of them came up quick enough
to hallal it.
</p>

<p>
During the night of the 2nd July some snow fell, and
caused some of our mules to stray in search of grass and
better shelter, and, what was worse still, forced upon us
a late start. We passed through a very barren, sandy
country, so much so that it was no surprise to us at
not finding the remotest trace of any one ever having been
there before. We calculated by our dead reckoning and the
plane-table that we had just crossed the eighty-fourth degree
of longitude, and if that were the case, we knew by the
latitudes we had taken that we must be about forty miles
south of the village of Iman Mula, which lies just south
of the Kuen Lun, or it would be more correct to say,
the place according to our map would be there, if in reality
such a village existed. At our first halt there was a hill,
quite close, completely covered with loose round stones
of a fossil-like appearance, or the equal halves of them,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
about the size of Tangerine oranges, one of which we
brought back with us. There was good water in the black
clayey soil that lay just below the surface, and we were able
to satisfy the most thirsty of our animals. During the day
there was thunder and a shower of snow. It seemed as
though there was about to be a breaking up of the grand
weather.
</p>

<p>
The men wanted us to give Sulloo some medicine which
would make him insensible, so that they might then sew up
a portion of his face. This we did not feel inclined to do,
as we did not know the proper amount of laudanum to dose
him with, and an attempt at sewing up his face on the top
of this would probably have done for the man. He had,
undoubtedly, gained some strength, for he was able to keep
up with the caravan on his pony.
</p>

<p>
Another snowstorm coming from the north, that blew
through the night, made the ground in heavy condition, so
that we had to make a late march. We passed through a
sandy, stony country, with low ranges of hills on either
hand, and further off another large range running as usual
almost east and west. Our difficulties throughout the day
were increased by the scarcity of water.
</p>

<p>
On the 4th of July we found ourselves marching down
a fine grassy nullah, with several others running into it
from the north and south, and we could not help thinking
that we had struck a nullah of some importance, that perhaps
it would eventually lead to the source of some river.
About a foot below the surface we could always get as much
water as we wanted and of a very fair quality. It was a
happy event to have some means of raising hopes of finding
people in the men's minds again. They were becoming
lazier and inclined to be insolent, and any kindness or consideration
we showed them was looked upon as so much
weakness on our part. Our only way of getting any real
work out of them was by behaving towards them with sternness<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
and severity, and showing a pretty sharp temper, much
as we disliked doing it. Towards evening the aspect of the
country underwent a change. Although there were still
grassy valleys, several of them and the intervening country
were adorned by curiously-shaped hills of sandstone.
</p>

<p>
Far away, some thirty or forty miles, in an east-north-east
direction, we saw a fine snow mountain range and peaks,
and decided to steer for the south side of them. On
climbing a hill it was obvious that the nullah we were in
ran straight away towards these mountains. This was
certainly encouraging. There would be no more trouble
in having to find a way, and there would be no anxiety
about our water and grass supply. The chances, too, were
that we should pick up a better supply of wild game
droppings for our fires, instead of having to dig up so much
boortsa each day, and on some occasions we had hardly been
able to collect enough to make a fire at all. We argued,
with regard to the range we should come to, that if there
were grass, streams from the snow, and shelter from the
hills, why should not there be wandering inhabitants of
the place?
</p>

<p>
Some time back a muleteer, Ghulam Russul, had taken
the post of headman in place of Tokhta, degraded for
incapacity. Ghulam Russul had been on a previous trip
with the Littledales, and knew the likely sort of country
where nomads love to dwell in. We had been warned
against this man by the Wazir of Leh, but then we considered
him the most suitable, out of a poor lot of men,
for the post of head muleteer. The sight of this range
added to Ghulam Russul's opinion that people might
be living there, and the knowledge that we must be
somewhere near Barkhalu, if there were such a place,
induced us to make the following plan. We arranged to
send Esau and Mahomed Rahim south, and Ghulam Russul
with Shukr Ali north, each man with enough rations to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
last for two days; this we were able to do, for fortunately
an antelope had just lately been shot. We furnished them
with the simple instructions to find people, get assistance
in the shape of some baggage animals, and return again into
camp a little lower down, but in the same nullah we were in.
We agreed that we might just as well not lose an opportunity
of making a few more miles, by marching the first
day without these four men. Before, therefore, these two
exploring parties sallied forth, they helped to load up. We
thought we could manage to drive them by ourselves for
one day, seeing that the way was clear, although our
numbers would be very small. Of a truth, when these
four men went off, there only remained, besides Malcolm
and myself, Lassoo and another man, called Usman, to
look after the caravan. This is really not enough, for one
man must lead the way in front; whenever, too, a load
during the march falls over to one side, the mule must at
once be reloaded, to prevent any chafing from a badly-balanced
burden. While this is occupying the attention
of two or three men, the rest of the mules will stray in
any direction, unless there are some more men present to
keep them together. Sulloo, as usual, would come along
behind, with one Juma to look after him, whose special
employment was as cook for the rest of the men. Shahzad
Mir, of course, would have to attend to his plane-table
work. Usman was a tall, black, powerful fellow, but not
fond of work; when Shahzad Mir's pony died he was
generally told off to carry the plane-table. This duty
suited him admirably, for he could put in many a snooze
throughout the day on the top of various hills. He used
to say he had travelled before, with a Russian through
Turkistan. As for Tokhta, who had swollen to a tremendous
size, resembling a large, over-ripe gooseberry, or rotten
apple, he had been sent out in the very early morning
to look after the ponies, for he was equal to no other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
greater exertion, but when it came to the hour of starting
there was no Tokhta present, nor could we discover what
on earth had become of him. In the end, we moved off
without him, knowing that when he awoke, for he was
probably slumbering peacefully in a sheltered nook, he
would find it no hard job to track us down the nullah we
were going along; besides, we intended halting all that
afternoon and the whole of the following day. Tokhta was
a regular drain upon us, for, although he had made up his
mind that he was unfit to do any more work, still he had
to have his share of the rations, much to the disgust of his
brother muleteers, who under such circumstances soon
lost all affection for one another, and had no scruples about
letting a man starve as long as it suited their own ends.
Having loaded the animals, we all started off together, the
men who had been selected to the north and south, and we
ourselves down the nullah.
</p>

<p>
About 9 o'clock we decided to halt, as already one of
the mules had collapsed half a mile back. After unloading,
we first of all dug a number of water holes, so as to have an
abundant supply for all. We next found out that some of
the animals required re-shoeing. We had leisure to see to
all things. Our little camp table had come to ruin, or
rather its legs had, but their place was taken by a couple of
yakdans, which served us equally well. Our two camp
chairs were still holding out; the most durable one that can
be had in India is from the Government workshops at Roorkee.
Most other chairs generally last for two or three weeks,
when they require nailing and binding up, only to give way
again shortly afterwards. Even at this early stage of our
journey, when we were buoyed up with the empty hopes of
our men finding signs of people and of Barkhalu, and of
bringing in yak, ponies, and provisions, we began to anticipate
the pleasures of our voyage across a portion of China,
down the Yellow River from Lancheo to Pao T'eo. With so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
many men, we argued that this would be quite the best way
of getting through China, as well as an inexpensive way, for
we could pack the whole of them on one boat, and ourselves
on another; or, better still, perhaps one boat would hold
both the men and ourselves. Leisure and a clear night
enabled us to take latitudes again from north and south
stars, showing us to be about 35 degrees, 20 minutes.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon of the following day Ghulam Russul
and Shukr Ali turned up, without any news whatever of
people. They told us how, after climbing a range of hills,
they had been able to see an immense distance, but that
there was nothing more than a continuation of grassy plains
without any water; this, too, with the help of field-glasses
we had provided them with. As Esau and Mahomed Rahim
had not turned up by sunset, we began to entertain hopes
that they had really found people, and that their delay was
caused by bargaining and persuading them to come to us.
Tokhta, too, had not turned up, and must have been having
a splendid sleep. It was blowing hard with sleet the next
morning, and this, combined with Esau's absence, kept us
imprisoned in our tent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER X.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
I SHOOT A YAK—DEATH OF ANOTHER MULE—"HELMET HILL"— WE
LEAVE TOKHTA AND SULLOO BEHIND—REDUCED
TO TWELVE ANIMALS—A MULE'S ADVENTURE.
</p>

<p>
About 8 o'clock all these excuses for repose came to an end,
for the sun began to shine, and with it Esau returned, bringing
Tokhta, whom, as we had rightly surmised, he had found
snoozing peacefully in a nullah. We could not help feeling
somewhat disappointed at the sleeper's return, for the chief
reason that the food he ate was like having so much wasted.
Nevertheless, had he not come in, we had arranged to send
back a search party for him. Esau had been equally
unsuccessful in his wanderings, and the only excuse for his
absence he could offer, was that he could not get back sooner!
</p>

<p>
We all moved off, once more reunited, down the nullah,
soon after 9 o'clock, and as I went ahead to feel the way, I
came to a spot where the nullah bifurcated. Here was
actual running water, and at the point of separation was a
hill on which grew fine green grass, and running half-way
up it were two long lines of white stones, piled up in small
heaps of three, showing me that at some time or other
people must have been there.
</p>

<p>
Whilst reconnoitring the surrounding country from the
top of the hill, I spotted in a valley about two miles away
a single yak grazing. Seeing by the lay of the land that
the caravan would have no difficulty in finding their way,
on arrival at this spot I went off on a little stalk, taking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
Ruby with me. I had to cross a broad expanse of sand,
where some antelopes had come to drink, before reaching the
grass land where the yak was feeding. After cautiously
crawling up to a crest from where I had calculated I
should be quite near enough to the yak to shoot him, to
my dismay there was no sign of the animal, but as I had
not seen him make off, I concluded he must have moved on
over some other crest, which now hid him from my view,
during the time of my stalk when he was out of my sight.
This proved to be the case, but it was only after crossing
several crests that I at length found him fast asleep in a
dip of the ground. Creeping up silently on tiptoe to within
100 yards, I woke him up rather harshly by placing a ·303
Jeffery bullet into a fatal part, and as he rose to learn the
cause, I knocked him over with a second bullet, much to
little Ruby's unbounded delight, who was soon scampering,
snapping, and barking around the dying body, worrying as
only terriers can. To cut the flesh off a dead yak is no
slight undertaking, so I retraced my steps to get assistance
from some of the men, but, on reaching the hill, there was
no sign of them. I climbed to the top again, and found
they had marched down the left branch of the nullah,
so soon made tracks for them. After about a mile tramp,
I came upon Mahomed Rahim and Shukr Ali asleep,
and by their side a little black mule on the point of dying.
Seeing they were doing no good, for the mule was too far
gone, I sent them on to catch up the other men and bring
back another mule, so that they could go to the dead yak
and fetch in some meat for Malcolm and myself, and for
themselves too, if they cared to eat it, in spite of it not
having been hallaled. The death of another mule had now
reduced us to fifteen.
</p>

<p>
The next day we still followed the same nullah, which
became so soft and so full of water that we suddenly found
ourselves bogged, and had no small trouble in extricating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
the animals and baggage out of such a mess on to the left
bank, which was nearest to the catastrophe. Despite our
misfortune, we could not help thinking that so much water
must surely lead to a fresh-water lake, and to more favourable
country. Very great, then, was our disappointment on
climbing to the higher ground to find the land was absolutely
barren and desolate, and what was more disheartening
still, after going a few more miles, to learn that this water
ran into a lake so salt that even the mules refused to
drink it. All around was an arid, stony desert; not a blade
of grass, no droppings nor roots wherewith to make a fire.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">WE CAMP IN A WILDERNESS AND STEER FOR "HELMET HILL."</p>
</div>

<p>
In the direction we intended going we could see a distant
hill in the shape of a helmet with a spike in it, so we
christened the curious eminence "Helmet Hill." As we
moved off towards this landmark we agreed that few things
are more detestable than having to march along the borders
of a salt lake, where the surroundings are absolutely barren
and lifeless; such land as this always seems to have a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
depressing effect on men and beasts, and one wonders why
there are such places. At night we most luckily found
some fresh water below the surface, in a sandy nullah, and
in a small valley close by grew some boortsa. This food
the animals generally preferred to grass, and there is no
doubt that in this coarse kind of short heather there is a
deal of moisture and sustaining power. As long as the
mules could get plenty of boortsa, they wanted but little
water.
</p>

<p>
Such adverse and inauspicious times as these made
their mark on our men, who lost heart and became lazier.
We consequently made a later start from the sandy nullah
than we should have done, and on coming to the end of the
lake, the sun being hot, we called a halt where we fancied
we should get water by digging. In this expectation we
were unfortunate, much to the annoyance of our muleteers,
and to make them feel that the misfortune was brought
about by themselves, we explained to them that had they
only risen and marched earlier we should by this time have
been some miles further on, and reached a place where
water could be obtained.
</p>

<p>
At this waterless camp we had to shoot a big, grey mule,
who could not possibly have done another march. He had
carried a load for many days, and we felt his loss severely.
This death reduced us to fourteen animals, including the
one that was kept spare for carrying Shahzad Mir's plane-table.
</p>

<p>
We felt we must come to a standstill unless people came
across our path before long. As the country was so barren
and desolate, we wanted to cover as much ground as possible
that same afternoon. I went on ahead, and so bare was the
aspect that it looked as though we should never see any
water or green again; everywhere the ground was incrustated
with salt; all the nullahs were white with it, and to
all appearance we were leaving bad for worse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At sunset, after which time it would have been impossible
to proceed and when most had given up hope, we came to
a nullah running down from the north, and to the surprise
and delight of all we found good water a few feet below
the surface, and a small quantity of boortsa on the adjacent
hills. A strong north wind blew hard during the night,
which made us wonder how our tent ever withstood the
tension. Two or three miles further on from this place, we
came to the bed of a salt lake partially dried up. Here
again misfortune overtook us, for some of the animals got
bogged, and nothing but an absolute desolation of salt land
still loomed ahead of us. The going became so heavy
that poor Sulloo on his pony, being unable to keep up, was
left miles behind. It is impossible to picture such a barren
land as we were in, and it seemed as though there would
never be an end to it as long as we pursued our eastern
course. We therefore struck a more northerly one, and
after eventually getting beyond the salt belt marched east
again. In some places we noticed a large amount of
yellow soil and in others of bright red. In spite of our
manœuvre we came to another dried salt lake, a disheartening
obstruction, and when our doubled exertions seemed
to be hopeless and our trials at their worst, we saw through
our glasses, some considerable way off, a small patch of
grass on a bit of rising ground. We were at once inspired
with new life and marched straight for this harbour.
The grass we reached grew at the foot of a nullah that
led over an easy pass, so we allowed the mules to enjoy
a few minutes' grazing before commencing the ascent.
This grass was quite green, and the joy of the animals
at meeting with such food was clearly manifest by the
avaricious way in which they tore it off, and the marvellously
quick way in which they ate it. Later on we came
to a broad, sandy nullah, with abundance of good water
just below the surface. The nullah, too, was itself well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
sheltered from the cold winds by the higher ground on all
sides, where splendid grass was sprouting. Antelope had
made no mistake in choosing this as one of their haunts
to wander into. In order to counteract the results due to
such depressing and demoralizing country as we had just
passed through, and as Sulloo and Tokhta were still in the
rear, we determined to make the most of our opportunity
and halt for half of the following day.
</p>

<p class="caption">MALCOLM AT BREAKFAST WITH ESAU.</p>
</div>

<p>
This was now the 10th of July and we had reached
Camp 51. We were well repaid for our decision, for the
following morning was perfectly glorious—not a cloud,
not a breath of wind was there to mar the quietude
that man and beast at this time so much needed. To
commemorate the occasion, I photographed Malcolm enjoying
his breakfast just outside the tent, with Esau standing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
by the other side of the table, holding in his hand a dish
of luxuries!
</p>

<p>
About midday, Tokhta, Sulloo, and the pony walked slowly
into camp. They persisted that nothing on earth would
induce them to travel onwards another step; poor fellows,
they had reached what seemed to them a perfect haven of
rest; they must have felt thoroughly worn out, for all they
wanted to do was to remain where they were and quietly die.
It was quite certain that it would have been madness for us
to remain with them, for only a few more days' rations
remained, and our only chance of getting through the
country at all lay in our coming across nomads from
whom by hook or crook we could get supplies. We did
think of leaving some men behind, while a small party
marched on as fast as possible with light loads in search of
people, but these men did not relish being left, and supposing
there were no people to find, our situation would have been
still more critical. We ended our problem by leaving the
two sick men with a pony and a supply of food and drinking
utensils, etc., so that if they felt inclined they might follow
after, for they would have found no difficulty in tracking
us. We buoyed them up, too, with the hopes we entertained
of shortly finding people, when we would at once send back
assistance to them. We also endeavoured to persuade them
to make an effort in reaching a fresh camp each day, by
marching and halting according to their inclination, for we
told them we should only make short marches, and at each
camp we would leave a supply of food for them and some
grain for the pony. It was a sad thing having to leave
these men and the pony as we did, and when we halted
for the night and the sun began to set calmly over these
vast solitudes, there was no sign of their coming, look back
as we might to the far-off hills for some tiny, distant, yet
moving, speck. The darkness of night soon gathered
around, and we could only wonder how close they might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
be to us. The next day we saw new life, for Malcolm had
a shot at a wild dog, while I saw two eagles; such sights
as these at once set our imagination at work, for we argued
as to how could these creatures exist unless people were
living somewhere close. At the same time it brought
encouragement to all.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening, after making two short marches during
the day, we camped south of the snow range we had been
steering for, but there were no signs to tell us that the
three abandoned ones were following. More food and
grain was left here, and we moved off soon after 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
It is, as some will know, chilly work sallying forth before
sunrise when the minimum registers over twenty degrees
of frost; and as one tramps along, marching only two
miles an hour with the animals, one eagerly watches for the
first tip of the sun to appear, meanwhile warming the
hands alternately inside the coat, for we always made a
point of carrying a rifle each.
</p>

<p>
It was my turn to go on ahead to-day, and after a brisk
walk of five miles I came upon a most inviting spot. There
were two tiny fresh-water lakes, surrounded by grassy hills,
with the snow peaks on the northern side feeding the hills
below with a daily supply of water. Fearing disappointment
in that the water might be salt, I hastened on to
the two pools, and, as I expected, they were fresh, so I
hurried back to climb some rising ground, from whence the
caravan would be in sight and earshot. There the firing
off of my gun announced to them, according to previous
arrangement, that water and grass had been found.

</div>

<p>
Whilst enjoying our midday halt a couple of antelopes
and sand-grouse came to drink, and fell victims to our guns
for their greediness. We all revelled in the abundance of
such good things, and would have much liked to lengthen
our stay; but on inspecting our supplies we found the men
had only fifteen days' rations left. We tried hard to persuade
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
them to subsist on half rations, as we ourselves had been
doing, and although at the time they finally expressed their
willingness to do so, and saw the expediency of the plan,
still they made their promise when filled with immense meals
of hallaled antelope and heavy chupatties, and we doubted
their power of abstaining. If they could have managed
to show more self-control over their food, we reckoned in
thirty more days on half rations we should cover another
three hundred miles, and we considered the fact of travelling
that distance further on, without meeting anybody, was an
absolute impossibility; besides, the general appearance of
the country was improving, and on that very evening we
actually encamped on the grassy banks of a small running
stream. It was an enticement to us to follow up this rivulet,
but the extreme southern course it took outweighed our
wishes. The men already began to grumble that they could
not work on half rations, this too when they had vast supplies
of meat from the antelope. The only advice we could give
them, was to eat up their food as fast as they could, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
then, when it was all gone, they would have to exist on still
less than they were now doing, if they wanted to live at all.
Whatever argument we brought forward had no weight
with such men, who would only think of appeasing their
wants for the time being. Although we spoke to them
harshly, still it was our fixed intention to strive our utmost
to shoot game for the men, so that they might save a little
of their rations, and sometimes at our midday halt we
would sally forth with rifles to try and bag something
before the afternoon's march. Even then it was only in a
grumbling frame of mind that a man would accompany us
to hallal the animal.
</p>

<p>
The muleteers, too, began on some occasions to quarrel
amongst themselves, and to threaten all kinds of punishments
to one another; but the mere threatening, and
actual carrying out, are very different things. Still, there
was a kind of feeling in the air that unless we got assistance
some calamity would befall us. Whilst on the march a big
black mule died, and as the pony with Sulloo had not come
in, this reduced us to only twelve animals, a very small
number indeed for the men to load and look after, and a
very small cause for them to complain of overwork.
</p>

<p>
At midday halt the spirits of the muleteers became more
discontented than ever, for no water could be found for a
long time, nor would any of them bestir themselves in the
matter; so unreasonable had they become that we doubted
our ever being able to forget and forgive their failings when
we came to the end of our journey. Towards evening we
saw a fresh-water lake, and camped a mile or so east of it,
choosing a spot by some good grazing. As the animals
had had no water that day, we drove them down to the
lake, but the banks all round were treacherous to such a
degree that one mule only just escaped drowning, so difficult
was it to drag him out of the heavy mud; and when we
eventually did, he had been so long in the water and was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
so benumbed, for the sun had set and a bitter blast was
blowing, that when we got him back to camp he was too
far gone to think of eating. He was a fine, powerful mule,
and his loss would have been severely felt by us. All our
warm putties, etc., were given up on this occasion, and the
frozen mule was bandaged up almost from head to foot.
The following morning great was our relief at finding
he was none the worse whatever for his lengthened drink
at the lake.

</p>

<p>
Before starting forth again we upbraided the head muleteer,
Ghulam Russul, for his chicken-heartedness and
bad example to the rest of the men. He denied a grumbling
spirit, and said he was brave and ready to undergo any
hardship, and follow us anywhere, but as to the other men,
he said they were a discontented lot. Knowing as we did
how he influenced them, his statement bore no weight with
us. We made a double march over undulating grassy
country, intersected by some broad gravel nullahs, running
almost at right angles to our course. South of us lay a
range of hills running east and west, making it appear as
though a river were running along at their base, and for
this reason we intended to steer gradually for them.
</p>

<p>
At night we found a well-sheltered nook, with water close
at hand, and such splendid grass that we were induced to
remain half the next day and feed up; besides, there had
been no signs at all of Tokhta and Sulloo, and we considered
this the last hope of ever seeing them again.
Henceforth we would make no more provision for their
coming, in the shape of leaving food and grain behind. It
was fortunate we had fixed on a half day's halt, for at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
daybreak there was a strong wind blowing from the north
with driving sleet. The grass at this camp, No. 56, had
far more nourishment in it than any other grass we had
come across up to the present, and Ghulam Russul remarked
that if we saw more grass like it we were sure to come
across nomads, so all were, for the time being, in a more
hopeful frame of mind. The melting snow had made the
marching somewhat heavy, and there was no lack of water.
</p>

<p>
Soon after starting, Malcolm, who had gone on ahead,
came hurrying back to me, with the request that I would
come with him and shoot an antelope, for he had seen a
great number of them. Shortly afterwards we saw a large
herd grazing or playing about as antelopes do, but one
of them, without the slightest provocation, came trotting
towards us; perhaps he was wondering whatever could have
brought such queer-looking creatures there as we were.
We sat down to make ourselves still more mysterious and
to receive him, when suddenly his instinct seemed to tell
him that there was just a suspicion of danger attached to
us, for he started off at a gallop, crossing our front at about
fifty yards distance. We both fired simultaneously at so
inviting a mark, and both hit. It was a sight worth seeing,
an antelope retreating at top speed in a second bowled
over quite dead, so much so that when Mahomed Rahim,
who was at hand, rushed up to hallal him, no blood would
flow from the operation, and the men declared it was not
fit for them to eat. In one way it was satisfactory to hear
them say this, for we were convinced that up to date they
had not been suffering from hunger. If they had, no hesitation,
through religious scruples, would have arisen about
eating the antelope's flesh.
</p>

<p>
We halted by a lake whose water tasted very nearly fresh,
but the banks were so treacherous that it was a hazardous
undertaking to get close to it, and after our previous
experience we preferred digging instead. This very likely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
accounted for the absence of game in the neighbourhood,
that they could not get to the water; but it is difficult to
account for the absence of birds on the lake itself, for there
was not even a Brahmini duck. A bright night, and we
made preparations for a very early start the next morning,
but the ill luck that sometimes accompanied us had brought
another storm, so that the ground bore a very white
appearance, and all idea of marching, for the time being,
had to be abandoned. By noon, although the ground was
still heavy, we ventured forth again, and hit off another
large lake containing water very nearly fresh.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the day storms continued to rage around
us amidst the adjacent hills, but, fortunately, none fell
actually over us; we could not help reflecting how all this
snow must have entirely baffled Sulloo and Tokhta in their
tracking us, that is, if they had attempted to do so. Everywhere
the country was beautifully grassy, and occasionally
we picked a new species of flower. Another large lake was
situated to the north of us, and during our march down
the valley the hills that lay both north and south were
gradually closing in. As we proceeded, the going became
more difficult. In addition to another snowstorm which
had fallen during the night, the valley became split up by
irregular nullahs and hills running in every direction, with
no defined features.
</p>

<p>
We continued making our double marches, and as the
loads were becoming lighter we hoped to cover fifteen miles
a day. One great continuous anxiety was the task of
finding enough game to shoot, that we might all live. At
one time it would be plentiful enough, at others for days
we could find nothing. On some nights we registered over
twenty degrees of frost, and still remained over 16,000 feet
above the sea level, and at this great height we actually
saw a brown butterfly.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th of July we began to notice the days were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
growing shorter, as the sun would rise just a few minutes
before 5 o'clock; but the whole country appeared to be
changing for the better, which in no small degree alleviated
our fears of being able to get across this high plateau before
the cold weather should set in. Generally speaking, everywhere
there was more grass growing, and, instead of the
coarse tufts we had been accustomed to see, their place was
taken by short crisp grass, the kind of growth that is so
much sought after by the nomads. We were, too, making
a very gradual descent, and felt convinced that, with such
natural signs, we must before very long hit off streams
which would lead us to some sort of civilization.
</p>

<p>
At our midday halt the men's spirits were more cheerful.
We had stopped in a fine broad nullah, running nearly
due east, with pleasant-looking grassy hills sloping down on
either side, and, with a cloudless sky and no wind, we were
glad to sit in our shirt-sleeves, whilst our twelve veteran
mules, with their saddles off, rolled in the sand before
enjoying the rich grass and water. We began to pick
fresh additions to our flower collection, the specimens being
chiefly of a mauve or white colour, and up to the present
time we had only found one yellow flower. At 7.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, in
Camp 61, at a height of over 16,000 feet, the temperature
was forty degrees Fahrenheit, and during the night there
were nineteen degrees of frost. Fine grass and fine weather
still favoured us, while the presence of a number of sand-grouse
indicated that water was at no great distance off.
</p>

<p>
Just after leaving Camp 62, we were all struck with
wonderment at finding a track running almost at right
angles to our own route. It was so well defined, and bore
such unmistakable signs of a considerable amount of traffic
having gone along it, that we concluded it could be no other
than a high road from Turkistan to the mysterious Lhassa,
yet the track was not more than a foot broad. Our surmises,
too, were considerably strengthened when one of the men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
picked up the entire leg bone of some baggage animal,
probably a mule, for still adhering to the leg was a shoe.
This was a sure proof that the road had been made use of
by some merchant or explorer, and that it could not have
been merely a kyang or yak track, or one made use of only
by nomads, for they never shoe their animals in this part
of the world.
</p>

<p>
Such a startling discovery as this bore weight with the
men, and nothing would have suited their spirits better
than to have stuck to the track and march northwards,
and they evidently thought us strange mortals for not
following this course; therefore, instead of being elated
with joy, they became more despondent than ever when
they found we were still bent upon blundering along in
our eastern route. But it was our strong belief that we
should for a certainty find people in a very few days' time, and
this being the case, we did not see the force of travelling in
a wrong direction, and put aside the objects for which we
had set out, just to suit the passing whim of a few craven-hearted
men, especially when we knew that the cause of their
running short of food and consequent trouble was entirely
due to their own dishonest behaviour. We did, however, send
one man, Mahomed Rahim, supplied with food, with instructions
to follow the road north as far as he had courage to
go, thinking that when he had crossed a certain range of
hills he would discover the whereabouts of people. Furthermore
we explained to him the way we intended going, so
that there could be no chance of his losing himself.
</p>

<p>
A mile or so further on we came to the dried-up salt bed
of a very ancient lake. The salt was in every shape and
form of crustation, and the whole lake for several miles
across was divided up into small squares with walls one to
three feet high, rugged and irregular. The going across
this was troublesome and arduous, first stumbling over one
wall, then crossing a few yards of crumbling, crystallised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
salt before another had to be scrambled over. Thus it
went on for mile after mile, and the length of the lake
being most deceptive it seemed as though we should never,
<i>never</i> cross it. As the sun rose higher some of the salt
composite melted, and then we found ourselves first in
slush, then on a bit of hard, rugged going, most liable
to cause a sprain to any of the mules. It became evident
that unless we were pretty smart in getting off the lake
altogether, we should find ourselves bogged there for the
rest of the day; thus our first idea of going straight ahead
across the lake had to fall through, and we steered for the
nearest shore, which was on the southern side, all the
time the ground getting worse and more treacherous.
When, only in the nick of time, we did stand on a sound
footing again, we congratulated ourselves that for once
only had we deviated a short way from our course.
Although this salt bed had proved such an unforeseen
obstacle in our line, still it was useful to us in another way.
The salt was of an excellent quality, and we were able to
replenish our store of this most necessary article, of which
there was so little left that we were carefully economising it.
</p>

<p>
During the morning's march next day we shot an antelope
and a kyang, and not wishing to delay the mules or to overload
them, we left two men behind, Ghulam Russul and
Shukr Ali, to cut up the meat and bring it in, whilst we
continued in search of a suitable spot for a midday halt.
This was a plan we frequently adopted, and there were
always volunteers to stop behind, for by doing so they
took good care to light a fire and feast on the tit-bits to
their hearts' content, and well fortify themselves before
carrying the load of meat to their fellow muleteers.
</p>

<p>
We had halted, and were expecting the arrival of these
two men, when Mahomed Rahim, who had been sent to
follow up the track, rejoined us, and as he approached we
could see he was weeping bitterly. On asking the man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
what ailed him, he sobbed out that he had lost his way.
He was a ludicrous sight, for he was a great, big, strong
fellow, and we asked him, if he wept like this at finding us
again after only being absent a day and a night, how would
he weep had he not found us at all? We fed up the great
baby with some unleavened bread, which he ate voraciously
amidst his sobs. Some kyang came trotting up to camp
with a look of wonderment at our being present there, and
as we were about to move off some antelopes also came to
inspect us.
</p>

<p>
The men carried quantities of cooked meat about their
persons, wrapped up in their clothes, and as they tramped
along they munched almost incessantly at the tough food
tending to make them very thirsty, so that when we halted
for the night they suffered considerably, for the water we
dug out was too salt for drinking.
</p>

<p>
The following morning we came to a most dreary-looking
region, ornamented only with a big salt lake, without any
vegetation or kind of life, making us eager to get across
such a solitude. At the east end of the lake we marched
over rising ground up a nullah about a couple of miles
before we came to some fairly good grass, where we called
a halt, never dreaming that we were doomed to an unpleasant
disappointment. On getting up some water from below the
surface, we found it to be the worst we had tasted, quite
impossible for man or beast to drink. Two of the men,
however, did gulp some of it down, and suffered in consequence
for their indulgence. Their thirst became far more
acute than was that of the rest of us. We were afraid that
should we find no water by the evening, it would go badly
with all. Some of the animals were too thirsty even to eat
the grass. We, therefore, made an earlier start than usual,
sending on ahead a couple of men to search for water
in some likely-looking ground that lay some distance on in
front on our right flank.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As we were marching along in silence, we suddenly saw
the two men were coming towards us, and as soon as they
drew near enough for the other muleteers to see by their
animated appearance that they had found water, they made
a general rush towards them, forgetful of what became
of the mules, or whether Malcolm and myself had any
water at all. Their one and only thought, as usual, was
themselves. A few miles further on we found two pools of
good water, and resolved to remain there half a day to give
the animals a chance of regaining their lost strength.
</p>

<p>
During the night our tent had great difficulty in withstanding
the wind, that blew with much violence, while
the temperature fell to twenty-one degrees of frost. As
we had run short of iron pegs, we found a most efficient
substitute in fastening the ropes to our tin boxes of ammunition.
On other occasions, too, the ground was so sandy
that pegs were entirely useless, and each rope had to be
fastened to a yakdan, or to one of our bags of grain.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon we marched along a broad, grassy,
and somewhat monotonous valley, steering for some snow
peaks we had seen the previous day. We found no game,
excepting sand-grouse, which, by their unmistakable notes,
made their presence known in the mornings up to 8 or 9
o'clock, and after sunset.
</p>

<p>
On the 26th July we left Camp 66, moving off by
moonlight, for the going was easy. On halting for breakfast,
two antelopes ventured to come and have a look at us,
and, of course, paid the penalty of death. Such an opportunity
as this was not to be thrown away, and laying them
together, I photographed them, and afterwards cut them up,
carrying as much meat as we possibly could manage—enough
for three or four days' consumption. The afternoon was
hot, like a summer's day in England. Some yak, resembling
big black dots, could be seen in several of the grassy nullahs:
a trying temptation to have a stalk after them, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
ground was of such a nature that with care one might have
come up to within a hundred yards of some of them without
being seen. But then it would have been useless to slaughter
them, so we contented ourselves with watching their movements,
and with making out what we could have done had
we been merely on an ordinary shooting trip, or had we
been hard up for meat.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-153" id="i-153"></a>
<img src="images/i-153.jpg" width="536" height="409" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TWO ANTELOPES ARE SHOT CLOSE TO CAMP.</p>
</div>

<p>
We met with a great misfortune that afternoon, for one
of the mules had been loaded so carelessly that its baggage,
consisting of two yakdans, fell off with a crash on to some
ground as hard as rock. One of these yakdans contained my
theodolite, and on opening up for the evening's observations,
I found the top spirit level was broken, and from that time
I had to be dependent only upon the sextant.
</p>

<p>
As usual we were off by 4.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and going on ahead, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
climbed up some hills to spy out the land. It was pleasant
walking, for grass grew everywhere, and in the lower-lying
ground were flowers and water. On crossing a certain
ridge I saw two yak grazing quietly, as they probably had
done without any interruption ever since they had been
dependent upon themselves for picking up a living. I sat
down silently, without, however, attempting concealment, to
enjoy the sight of watching carefully, at so short a distance,
the habits of these massive, dark-haired cattle at home in
their wild state. At length the caravan, which had been
marching along on much lower ground, over grassy valleys,
came in sight, a signal that I must push ahead again and
reconnoitre. I rose, therefore, and walked up towards the
two yak, and one of them was so tame and eager to make
out whatever on earth I was, that he allowed me to walk
up to within forty yards of him, so that, had I chosen, I
might have given him a very telling shot. As it was, he
merely trotted off a short way and started grubbing again.
</p>

<p>
Ahead of us was a range of mountains, an imposing sight,
with grand snow peaks, the very ones we had been steering
for. From the high ground it seemed as though there was
a pass leading over them between two of the peaks, but
entirely without vegetation. It was impossible to make
out how far the pass went, and what would be in store
for us after we had reached the point as far as we could
see. We calculated that the climb in our present condition
could not have been done in one march, and wondered how
we could strengthen our animals sufficiently for the second
march, if there were no grass at the end of the first. We
knew from experience that an ascent of this description
would have taken more out of our mules than several days
of ordinary marching, and therefore determined to abandon
the idea of surmounting the pass, or rather what appeared
to be a pass, but to strike north, finding a way somehow or
other round the entire range.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As we steered for some extra good-looking grass and water
by which to make our midday halt and give the mules their
midday graze, a couple of inquisitive yak actually came
trotting after us, keeping at a distance of two or three
hundred yards. Such boldness augured well for a plentiful
supply of good meat in the future. We were glad to pitch
our tent in this pleasant spot for a few hours, and even
under that shade the maximum thermometer registered
seventy-five degrees.
</p>

<p>
Having breakfasted off our antelope meat and some good
tea, we were busy with our maps, and drying flowers, etc.
Everything was spread out—for such frail specimens it was
a splendid opportunity; the men were sleeping, too. The
mules, having eaten their fill, were standing still enjoying
the rest and perfect peace; all was absolute silence, with
the exception of our own chatting to each other, as we
amused ourselves with our hobbies, when without a
moment's notice a powerful blast of wind caught us with
such violence that the tent was blown down and many
things were carried completely away, and our camp, which
only a second ago had been the most peaceful scene
imaginable, became a turbulent one of utter confusion, as
every one jumped up in an instant, anxious to save
anything he could lay hold of, or to run frantically after
whatever had escaped—for some things were being carried
along at a terrific rate. Fortunately the loss, compared to
the excitement, was trifling; but we made up our minds
not to be caught napping in this way again.
</p>

<p>
That same afternoon, after marching north, we crossed a
river that took its rise from the snow peaks; the bed was
sandy, about half a mile across, with several small, swiftly-flowing
streams about a foot deep, which had to be crossed
barefooted. This was the largest body of water we had as
yet come across, and there was much speculation amongst
us as to where it would lead, and we thought we should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
at any rate not lose sight of its course. Splendid green
grass and flowers were flourishing everywhere. Vegetables,
too, were a valuable addition to our table, for besides the
"kumbuk" and "hann," we here first found the wild
onion, which afterwards formed the chief staple of our
food. Onions cut up into pieces and fried in yak's fat,
was a dish appetising at these great heights in the absence
of other food, besides being very sustaining and an excellent
medicine for all internal complaints. On some nights the
mules and ponies were wont to stray, but with such good
grass close at hand, and the presence of water in more
than one place, as a rule they did not go very far; but,
as we could not run the risk of a long delay, the first thing
in the morning, they were nearly always watched throughout
the night in turn by the men. We found a nullah with
a small stream in it running eastwards, rising all the time,
and marched up it, leaving the river to wind its way north;
we had no real fear of losing it, for we could see it turned
east again later on. At the top of the pass we found
another nullah running northwards, and followed this down
to a prairie-like looking valley, thence on to a beautiful lake.
At the western extremity we could see it was fed by the river
we had crossed the day before. All around the valleys and
hills were green, and on many of them the grazing yak
were dotted about in great numbers.
</p>

<p>
As we were now running short of meat I instituted a
stalk against one of them, and took a vast amount of trouble
and exertion in order to come to a close range before firing,
little knowing that it was a waste of labour, as one could
have approached them with taking only ordinary precautions.
Close to the yak were several kyang, who were the more
watchful of the two, for they were the first to notice my
crawling along and at once stood up in bewilderment, but
beyond that they did nothing more, so that I was enabled,
without in the remotest degree disturbing the yak, to get
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
within sixty yards of them. There I took my shot and
bowled over with a single bullet the one which I considered
to be the juiciest-looking one in the herd. The rest of them
merely raised their heads for a moment at the unwonted
noise, and then began to graze again, making no attempt
to escape. I, too, then rose, and it was only after a deal
of shouting that they grasped that it really was rather
dangerous to remain where they were, thereupon off they
trotted across the valley, far, far away. Not so the herd
of kyang, who appeared the most disturbed at first; they
continued to manœuvre around the whole time we were
there, as though inviting us to try our skill on them, but
one dead yak is oceans of meat for a much larger caravan
than ours, for many a day.
</p>

<p>
As soon as one of the men had come up, I told him to
look sharp and cut its throat for it was not quite dead,
although in reality it had breathed its last some ten minutes
ago. He at once set to work, but so tough was the hide,
and so blunt his knife, that he could not cut through
it, and merely first pricked it with the point; and although
no blood exuded, he nevertheless told the other men that
he had properly hallaled the brute, and they by this
time having become less scrupulous with regard to their
religious custom, made no bones about arguing as to
the meat being unfit for them to eat. As a matter of
fact they were beginning to learn what real hunger was.
Some of them came to help cut off the meat in a business-like
sort of way, pretending not to examine the throat at all.
</p>

<p>
As we made our midday halt only a hundred yards from
the carcass, all fed right royally, and carried off large lumps
of the flesh as well. The men, too, were in high spirits, for
they had found a very old chula, or fireplace, consisting of
three stones, and what was still more joyful tidings, close
to the dead yak ran a narrow track actually in the direction
we intended going.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
</p>

<p>
About here we also saw some new creatures—large
marmots, butterflies, and hoopoos. I skinned one of the
latter. Such fresh sights, and the discovery of the
track in addition to the improvement in the climate,
the grass and abundance of water, made all eager to be
off again in expectation as to where the track would
lead us.

<h2>
CHAPTER XII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ25">
A FOOTPRINT—SHAHZAD MIR INDISPOSED—DESERTION OF
MULETEERS—A RAINY NIGHT.
</p>

<p>
It was now the 28th of July, and we had reached a spot
between our night encampments 69 and 70, the day camps
not being recorded in the map. Since leaving Lanak La on
the 31st of May, we had been daily finding our own way across
country, over mountains and valleys, along nullahs and
beds of rivers, etc., and at last we had found a track we
could follow. Such a sensation was novel to us. We
could scarcely grasp that there was no need to go ahead to
find a way. We had simply to follow our nose. We
thought that our troubles were nearly finished, and for
the rest of our journey that there would be easy marching,
and every moment we quite expected that the dwellings
of mankind would heave into sight. Especially, too, when
one of the men picked up a stout stick, three or four feet
long, which must have been carried there by somebody
or other, for since leaving Niagzu the highest species of
vegetation we had seen was the wild onion. Some of the
men also declared that they had found a man's footprint.
Personally we did not see this sign of civilization, but the
men maintained there could be no mistake about it, for
they said it was the footprint of a cripple!
</p>

<p>
Besides all this comforting news, there was no need to be
tramping over the hills in search of game for food. The
antelope, yak, and kyang were plentiful and easily shot in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
all the valleys, and, had we been so disposed, we might
have shot a dozen yak during the afternoon's march.
When we halted for the night one of the wild yak actually
came and grazed amongst our mules!
</p>

<p>
We camped at the entrance of a winding nullah, along
which grew rich grass, and being tempted by the shelter,
some of the mules wandered up it during the night and
thus forced upon us a late start the next morning; but as
there was a strong wind blowing, this somewhat counterbalanced
the otherwise too over-powerful heat of the sun.
</p>

<p>
Our track led up a fine grass valley, where we could
actually smell the wild flowers, but as we continued the
track became less defined, till eventually there was no
track at all. We spread out to the right and left hand,
but without success. Whether it had turned off to north
or south it is impossible to say. For the moment we were
disappointed at the overthrow of all our hopes, and instinctively
felt that our journey had not quite come to an end.
</p>

<p>
We had been marching uphill, and at the top of the
valley found a fast-running rivulet taking its rise from the
snow mountains that lay south of us, the same range that
had blocked our way and compelled us to make the detour.
Added to the work of once more having to find our own way,
the country took a change for the worse. Although there
was no difficulty about the water, still there was less grass,
the soil became slatey, and in places barren. Storms
began to brew around us, but we were lucky in being
favoured with only some of the outlying drops. We had
a perfectly still night with one degree of frost.
</p>

<p>
It had been our custom, especially on dark nights, to
make the men take their turn of guard over the mules, to
watch and see that they did not stray. They were far too
precious to lose, and by marching in the early morning,
felt less fatigue.
</p>

<p>
On this particular morning, 30th July, Camp 70, no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
mules were forthcoming at the time when we wanted to
load up, and it turned out that the man, Usman, who
should have been on watch, was fast asleep in some
secluded corner. It was only the previous night that this
very man, after unloading the mules, had been sent to
fetch some water for the other men and ourselves, but as
we waited and there was none forthcoming, another man
was sent to see what was the matter. He found Usman,
having had a good drink himself, contentedly sleeping with
the empty water-skin by his side. We therefore had no
inclination to go in search of him on this particular morning,
but after collecting the mules from all quarters, loaded
up without him.
</p>

<p>
Our twelve mules with fairly light loads seemed to be
stronger and fitter than they had been for a long time, no
doubt due to the excellent green and sufficiency of water
they had of late enjoyed. We had besides become better
acquainted with the carelessness and laziness of our men,
whom we used to watch very closely, never trusting them
entirely.
</p>

<p>
After marching about a mile, we crossed a narrow track
running north and south. Here again we were much
tempted to take the northern route, but as our mules were
so fit, we still stuck to our eastern one, daily expecting
more than ever to find people.
</p>

<p>
Another inducement for doing so was that of late there
had been little difficulty in keeping all well supplied with
meat. It thus happened that when everything was in our
favour, we were sanguine of accomplishing our journey
without any further mishap. We crossed over several cols
and saw fresh-water lakes, while yak, kyang, antelope, and
sand-grouse were plentiful.
</p>

<p>
Storms had been threatening a great part of the day to
break over us, but were held in check by some extra high
peaks. In the evening, however, we had crossed a broad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
sandy bed of a river, wherein a shallow stream was flowing,
and had just pitched our tents in a small sandy nullah,
well sheltered from the wind, when down came the rain in
real earnest.
</p>

<p>
We were sorry to find that Shahzad Mir had not come
in, though very shortly the man who was carrying the
plane-table walked up, saying that Shahzad Mir had stopped
the other side of the stream with a pain in his stomach.
We knew quite well what was the cause of this. He had
been taking some chlorodyne and afterwards had eaten
enormous quantities of meat. As there was nothing to be
gained by getting anybody else soaked, we sent back the
same man to fetch him in. The night was very dark
and the rain turned to snow, still neither of them came.
Fearing that on account of the darkness they had gone
astray, we popped outside and fired off our gun at intervals;
still the ammunition was wasted. Nothing but daybreak
brought them back, when it turned out that they had been
so ridiculous as to sleep in a nullah only a few yards from
our camp. They had even heard the shots, but still could
not find us. Neither of them was any the worse for the
outing, in fact the result had been beneficial, for the
stomach-ache from which Shahzad Mir had been suffering
was completely cured. They caused a good deal of merriment
amongst us all, and we all thought they might have
selected a more suitable night for sleeping out of camp.
</p>

<p>
The ground was covered with snow, so it was out of the
question to think of marching early. We were rather
anxious to cover a few more miles that morning. It was
the last day of the month, and since leaving Leh we had
marched very nearly a thousand miles, and we thought we
would like to start a fresh thousand on the 1st of August.
To our delight the sun made an appearance quicker than
we had anticipated and the snow was very soon thawed,
allowing us to move off again at 11 o'clock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-163.jpg" width="424" height="546" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHAHZAD MIR AT WORK.</p>
</div>

<p>
The day was fine and warm, and as I went on ahead to
explore, I saw below me some grassy hillocks, and, grazing
in their midst, a fine yak. I thought it would be interesting
to make a stalk just to see how close it was possible to get
without disturbing him. I walked down the hill I was on
and dodged in and out between the hillocks, always keeping
out of sight, still getting closer and closer, till at last there
was only one small hillock that separated us, not more than
half a dozen yards. But when I stood up before him and
he raised his head, for he was intent upon grazing, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
saw me, his look of utter bewilderment was most amusing
to see. He was so filled with astonishment, as the chances
are he had never seen a human form before, that it was
some moments before he could collect his thoughts sufficiently
to make up his mind and be off.
</p>

<p>
Further on were many streams, forming their own course
over a very broad, sandy river bed, all swollen on account
of the recent rain. Although we were at an altitude of
16,000 feet we felt no discomfort in taking off our boots
and stockings and paddling across and about the streams,
collecting bits of stick wherewith to make a fire for our
breakfast of venison and fried onions.
</p>

<p>
To-day we were only making a single march, and in the
afternoon halted by a pool of rain-water on some high
ground, well sheltered on all sides from the wind by a
number of sandy mounds. From here we had magnificent
views of the massive snow mountains that surrounded us,
looking grander than ever from the fresh supply of snow.
</p>

<p>
In the direction we intended marching there seemed to
be abundance of water, but whether rivers or lakes were
in store for us it was impossible to make out. We rested
the following morning, enjoying the warm sunshine and the
glorious scenery, and would fain have remained there when
the time came to load up and continue our journey.
</p>

<p>
The water, about which we had been unable to make up
our minds, proved to be a large shallow salt-water lake.
We found it best to march round by the southern shore.
In some places there were tiny rivulets flowing into it, which
caused us some trouble in crossing, for the bottom and
ground around was muddy. Otherwise the going was good,
and we marched on till it was almost dark.
</p>

<p>
Our men that morning had behaved in a peculiar way,
for each of them had come to make his salaam to us; not
that we attached much importance at the time to it, still
it flitted across our minds that they were becoming very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
faithful muleteers all at once, and perhaps intended doing
better work for the future. That evening we impressed
upon them the necessity of making double marches again,
as the last two days we had only made single, and told them
how impossible it was to march much further without
meeting somebody, and gave orders for them to commence
loading at 3.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
</p>

<p>
On waking up the following morning we found no
attempt was being made to collect the mules, and it was
5 o'clock before they could be induced to bring them all in
from grazing. Then we noticed that muttering was going
on, but no attempt at loading up. Failing to elicit any
reply from them for their conduct, I upbraided them
severely for their laziness, and told them that if the only
thing they wanted was to remain where they were and not
come along with us any more, to do so by all means, but
that Malcolm, Shahzad Mir, and myself, whatever they
might choose to do, intended marching. Thereupon they
replied sullenly that they would go no further, and
hurriedly taking up their belongings from amongst a
heap of baggage, they moved off in a body in a southerly
direction, and were soon hidden from sight by the rising
ground.
</p>

<p>
All this happened in a very short space of time, and
fortunately, at the moment of the dispute, Esau and Lassoo
were a little way off, busy with our things, or they too would
have joined the deserters, as they one day afterwards told
us. As it was, when we began to collect the mules again to
try and load them, Lassoo was very uncertain in his mind
as to which party he should throw his lot in with. Had he
gone off with the muleteers, our difficulties would have
been doubled, for none of us had had much experience in
loading mules, and, even with it, loading a mule properly
is no easy matter, whereas Lassoo had been a muleteer,
and was far handier and quicker at the work than any of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
our other men. This we had already noticed, as he often
used to give them a helping hand.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before we could collect all the mules
again. Some of them seemed to know there was something
up, and there was every chance of their being deserters.
One little black chap in fact was so clever at evading our
united efforts to catch him, that we had to give him up as a
bad job, and load eleven animals instead of twelve.
</p>

<p>
We were reduced to so small a party that Shahzad Mir
had to carry the plane-table. Either Malcolm or myself,
taking a mule by the head rope, would lead the way, leaving
only three to drive the mules along and keep them together,
and readjust the loads, which was frequently necessary
owing to our inexperience.
</p>

<p>
On looking over our baggage we found we had made one
great mistake; we had allowed the muleteers to go off with
the twenty remaining pounds of flour. But we had no
inclination to run after them; they might have led us a
chase for days, by which time the flour would have been
eaten. What we were most anxious to do was to let these
men see that we were in a position to be independent of
their help, for we surmised they would very likely be
watching us from a distance.
</p>

<p>
We learnt afterwards that these muleteers had deserted
in accordance with a preconcerted plan, formed even before
leaving Shushal, on the Pangong Lake, when every man
had sworn to follow Ghulam Russul, whatever he might
choose to do, and they had agreed amongst themselves to
leave us as soon as the rations ran short. Furthermore,
Ghulam Russul, whom they well knew had been with
Littledale on his last famous journey, had deluded them
into the idea that he could show them the way into
Lhassa. They had imagined that if they all left us, it
would be impossible for us to load up and march without
them, and that we should be compelled to remain where we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
were. At night-time they had planned to come and steal
our mules and ride on them to the capital.
</p>

<p>
As we moved off, we felt somewhat anxious in our minds
as to whether we should find water, grass, and droppings
for our fire, for if we met with ill luck we thought it quite
probable that Esau and Lassoo too would join the muleteers.
This of course would have been suicidal to them, as we were
some 300 miles from Lhassa, which, as far as we knew, was
the nearest inhabited place, and the exact direction of it
they could not possibly have known.
</p>

<p>
We made a long march, longer than we had made for
many a day, till we came to a large salt lake, round which
we had to skirt. Everywhere grassy nullahs sloped down
to it, and during the afternoon we came to a secluded nook
with a pool of fresh water, and all around were the dried
droppings of yak; evidently the place was a favourite haunt
of these animals. This was a perfect camping ground for
us, and, to prove to our two men how favourable our kismet
was, we decided to halt. We all set to work with the
unloading and watering of the mules, pitching the two
little tents, making fires, and the numerous other little jobs
always connected with making a camp. It seemed peaceful
and quiet after all the grumbling and bickering we had
been accustomed to. We were close by the edge of the lake,
completely concealed in a hollow by rising ground on all
sides, and we were rather anxious that the mules should
not stray too high up and disclose our whereabouts. We
concluded that these muleteers would not have sufficient
courage and determination to march straight away, and
were prepared to see an attempt being made any moment
at capturing some of the mules.
</p>

<p>
Towards sunset we made preparations to guard against
a surprise by night. We fastened a rope to the ground,
very securely, between the two tents, to which we could
picket the mules. In one tent was Malcolm and myself,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
and in the other Shahzad Mir, with Esau and Lassoo. At
dusk we fastened all the mules to this rope, and arranged
for each of us to take turns in watching throughout the
night. Another advantage gained by this plan was that
the animals were ready for us to load the first thing in the
morning. Had we allowed them to stray during the night
our work would have been doubled; as it was, it took us an
hour and a half to load up. We also decided to make one long
march instead of two, for being so short handed, all our
time would have been spent in catching the mules and
loading them. Besides, as we could not let them graze by
night, we should have to give them more time by day.
</p>

<p>
Soon after dark, when everything was in readiness for
the night, rain began to fall; it rained, as the saying goes,
cats and dogs, such as we had never seen it rain before.
All five of us were snug, dry, and warm in our little tents,
from which we could watch the mules, whilst the deserters
must have spent a most miserable night without any shelter
and food, and the hot tea which they all loved so much.
We felt that they were being deservedly punished for their
sins. Esau and Lassoo soon realized how much they had
already gained by following us, and they swore to stick to
us through thick and thin, and this for evermore they
undoubtedly did.
</p>

<p>
It rained during the greater part of the night, so that the
sodden condition of the ground put all idea of early marching
out of our head.
</p>

<p>
In order to lessen our work, and to make the marching
easier for the mules, we decided to load only ten of them,
and let two always go spare. We made a pile of the
things we should not require, such as the muleteers' big
cooking pot, and their tent, etc., and left them at the camp.
By thus lightening our loads we reckoned we should be
able to march sixteen or eighteen miles a day, an astounding
fact for the muleteers, who had imagined we could not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
move without their aid. We drew comparisons between the
welfare of the men with us and that of the deserters. The
latter were possessors of all the flour and most of the cooked
meat and the tobacco, but no cooking pots, while the former
had three days' rice and plenty of tea, cooking utensils, and
shelter at night, an advantage they were already fully
aware of.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ35">
RETURN OF THE DESERTERS—SHUKR ALI—LONG MARCHES—DEATH
OF EIGHT MULES AND A PONY—A CHEERING REPAST.
</p>

<p>
On leaving Camp 74 on August 3rd, we had to cross an
arm of the lake, or rather to make our way round it, for
the rain had made the sand too soft to admit of our
venturing on it. After marching for some considerable
time, we therefore found ourselves just opposite our camp
of the previous night, separated only by a narrow strip
of treacherous ground. When we had gone thus far we
noticed something or other moving on the crest of the high
ground above our old camp, and on closer examination,
by means of our field glasses, discovered that these moving
objects were no other than the reappearance of the deserters.
Soon afterwards another one came into sight, and then
another. It struck us as highly probable that there had
been some disagreement in the party, and that they were
already beginning to taste the fruits of their crime.
</p>

<p>
We pretended to take no notice of them whatever, but
rather increased the rate of our marching, keeping the
animals close and compact, so that they might see for
themselves how easy it was for us to manage without them.
We could see them steering for our last night's encampment,
where they no doubt stopped to regale themselves
over a meal with the flour they had taken away, and to
inspect and take whatever they fancied of the things we
had left behind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In order to save ourselves the trouble of searching for
roots for our fire and vegetables on arrival at camp, we
used each of us to pick up whatever we could during the
march, putting the droppings of wild animals and roots
into one bag, and the vegetables into another, which were
hung on the back of one of the spare mules.
</p>

<p>
During our march of sixteen miles we saw nothing more
of the deserters. We came to the conclusion that they
must either have spent a considerable time over cooking
their flour, and would catch us up again afterwards, or else
we thought it just possible that having seen us marching
along apparently without any difficulty, and having found
their big cooking pot at the camp, they had concluded that
it would be a hopeless task to pursue us any further, and
had decided to steer a course of their own for Lhassa.
</p>

<p>
After passing over undulating grassy country, we halted
on the south side of a salt-water lake, Camp 75, hidden in
a secluded nook amidst the hills which rose from the
water's edge. On the north side, some four or five miles
off, ran a range of hills topped with snow peaks.
</p>

<p>
We found, by choosing a spot like this, that the muleteers
could not have discovered our whereabouts from any
high ground they would cross, and that to do so they would
have to come right up to us. Our march had taken us
over seven hours, so that as soon as camp had been pitched
and water brought, it was time to collect and picket the
mules for the night between our two tents, and begin our
night watches.
</p>

<p>
During these lonely night watches, the absolute silence
that reigned in this uninhabited country can never be
described. The slightest movement of man or beast was
so easily heard that it would have been impossible for a
stranger to approach unnoticed. One's thoughts on these
solitary occasions would wander far, far back, to others who
slept peacefully amidst a scene of luxury and comfort. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
order to keep ourselves awake and warm, we used to keep
a pot of water in the red-hot ashes of our fire, and brew
ourselves a cup of cocoa. I remember every step I took, or
anything I laid hold of, seemed to make such a noise, that
every moment I expected every one to awake, forgetting that
sleep was sounder then than at other times.
</p>

<p>
The night passed off quietly, and at 4 o'clock we were
all five of us busily engaged packing and loading up for
another long march. So intent were we upon our work that
at first we failed to notice that the deserters had actually
reappeared, and were standing in doleful plight some little
way off, without venturing to come up to us. Thereupon
Malcolm and I approached them, chiefly with the object of
searching the bundles they were carrying, to see whether
they had any flour left, or anything else that would be useful
to us. Strange to say, one of them, and the greediest,
Mahomed Rahim, had brought on his shoulder the huge
cooking pot in which the tea and soup used to be cooked
for all the men. It was evident that he, at any rate, had
hopes of our taking them into our service again, in which
case he must have thought of the praise he would get from
the other men for having thus exerted himself.
</p>

<p>
It was far from our intentions to take them on again
as our servants, and how could we have been expected to?
Had we felt that they would have served us faithfully, we
should have unhesitatingly forgotten and forgiven their
folly, but we instinctively felt that the only chance we
had of accomplishing our journey without mishap was to
throw off for good and for all these most ungrateful, unreliable
men, who were bringing their own destruction upon
themselves.
</p>

<p>
We made a single exception, in taking again into our
service one man, by name Shukr Ali. We had a liking for
him, and knew he was blessed with a family. He came
under the condition that if he worked well and honestly, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
would be entirely forgiven his misconduct, and would receive
his entire wages, like the two men who had remained
faithful. From what Shukr Ali told our two men, it was
quite certain that our decision with regard to the remainder
was not ill-judged.
</p>

<p>
After the delay we moved off steadily again, and for the
first time found wild rhubarb growing. Besides this, we
had found a moth and a beetle. All this encouraged us
in the belief that we must be drawing nearer to more genial
climes, and possibly, too, to some habitations of men.
</p>

<p>
Whilst making these long marches of sixteen or eighteen
miles a day, which would take us eight or nine hours,
we used to call a halt about half-time for a few minutes,
when we found a place where extra good grass was growing,
that whilst the mules grazed, all might recoup themselves
with a little rest, and satisfy in some slight degree the
hunger from which we always suffered, by eating some cold
meat and any vegetables we could find.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, after pitching camp, I had gone to the top
of some adjacent hills to collect onions, for they generally
grew on the higher ground. Whilst so employed, I chanced,
as one was wont to do, to look round the surrounding
country, and saw in the distance some men coming along
in the same direction that we ourselves had come. Of
course, I knew it must be another reappearance of the
deserters. Not wishing to speak to them any more, nor
that they should speak to our two men for fear they might
contaminate them, I shouted to Shahzad Mir to take his
gun and meet them, and forbid them to follow us any
further. Until we felt certain that they had ceased to track
us, the watching over our mules was a constant anxiety
for all.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, the occasion when Shahzad Mir
turned these men back was the last on which we saw them.
The nights we spent afterwards watching over our little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
camp, in half expectation of their sudden reappearance,
were, as it turned out to be, only a waste of rest and energy,
for we never saw these men again, and whether they found
their way to Lhassa is a doubtful question. Whatever fate
befel these wretched men, it was brought on by their own
deeds, and against our most earnest endeavours to do all
in our power for them. Whatever was in store for them
they most assuredly deserved. They had tried and hoped
to leave us to fate in the midst of solitude, and had
curiously enough served themselves out with this very
same punishment.
</p>

<p>
After this event all went smoothly and cheerily; all
worked equally and with a will as one man. The mules,
too, grew stronger on the excellent grass we had come to,
and wild onions and rhubarb were abundant everywhere.
Afterwards grass became scarce again, and one day we had
to march twenty miles before a spot suitable to camp in
could be found. Here lay a small lake, which, to our
disappointment, was of brackish water, resulting in our
having to resort to our original plan of digging. The night
by this lake, Camp 78, was warm, the temperature not
falling below forty degrees Fahr. Ahead of us the land
appeared to be studded with lakes, and we decided to steer
along the north side of them.
</p>

<p>
As rain had fallen during the early morning the tents
were heavy, but the level marching in some degree compensated
for this misfortune. That which we had surmised
to be a number of lakes proved to be one salt one, which
alone relieved the barren country we had quite unexpectedly
marched into. The prospect, too, of shooting any game
was disheartening, nor did there seem any chance of the
mules getting any more grass. Yet once again, when
our fortune was at a very low ebb, providential and
unaccountable help was at hand, for suddenly there appeared
in this desert country a solitary antelope. Our only reason
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
for his being there was that he had lost his way. He was
astonishingly tame, and easily shot. Even more wonderful
still was our finding, in the middle of this expanse of sand,
salt and gravel, a kind of oasis, consisting of about an acre
of rising ground, covered with beautiful grass, and when we
began to dig we found good water just below the surface.
Instead of reading about some fairy tale, we were really
acting one.
</p>

<p>
Soon after pitching our camp in this garden of plenty
rain fell heavily. We thought of the deserters, and
wondered what shelter or food they had providentially
found. During the night the rain ceased, and a hard frost
set in. When we began to load up, we found our tent was
just like a sheet of thin iron, and the only way of folding it
up was to bend the ends over and then stand on them.
</p>

<p>
We crossed some hills, and then descended into a valley
of sandy soil. There was also rich grass, and several
small streams flowed across the valley, taking their rise
from the snow peaks north of us. Here we saw immense
herds of antelope, all females and young ones. They were
so timid that it was impossible to get nearer than 600 or
700 yards to them. Far away in the hills, too, we saw
numbers of yak. We concluded that as thousands and
thousands of wild antelope had chosen this pasture-land to
live in, surely it must be a befitting place also for nomads
and their flocks. We wondered why there was nobody
living there, and still more that we could find no signs
that anybody ever had done so. In this valley we even
found a wild orchid. On arrival—we had marched sixteen
miles in six hours—all the twelve animals were in fit and
strong condition.
</p>

<p>
During the next day's march we again saw thousands of
antelope, and the country was everywhere well watered,
with abundance of good grass, rhubarb, and onions. All
day long we had been gradually mounting, and just before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
halting, at a spot which we considered to be the top of our
pass, we saw in a nullah close by a wild animal resembling
a prodigious cat. Coming to close quarters, I killed her
with my shot-gun; and on proceeding a little further up the
nullah I found the remains of a young antelope, and,
crouching under a rock near to the carcass, two small thickly-coated
animals, no doubt the young ones of the mother
I had just slain. They were strong little fellows, with
large powerful paws, and difficult to hold; one in fact was
as much as a man could manage. The dead mother we
skinned, and brought her skin and skull back to India.
We also made arrangements for keeping the two young
ones, in hopes of bringing them back alive. We put each
in a separate nosebag, tied up in such a way that the head
remained outside. They were then hung, one on each side,
on the back of a spare mule, and thus carried with impunity.
</p>

<p>
Our route took us along the edge of a fresh-water lake, on
the banks of which was very fine vegetation. We discovered
we had made a mistake the previous evening in imagining
we had reached the summit of the pass, for after leaving
the lake we had twelve more miles of uphill marching over
a good deal of heavy ground and most barren country, the
only vegetation being rhubarb. Several nullahs, too, had
to be crossed. As we drew near the top three of our
animals became completely knocked up, necessitating a
rearrangement of the loads, and all the others were showing
signs that they would suffer the same plight, had we insisted
on continuing our march.
</p>

<p>
After climbing uphill all day long, we were thus compelled
to halt for the night in one of the most unsuitable places
conceivable. We were right on the summit of the pass,
and ahead of us we could see nothing but absolutely barren
land; therefore, to have gone any further would have
only increased our difficulties, for more animals would
certainly have succumbed after a very short distance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
We calculated that by giving the mules a night's rest
and some of our very limited store of grain, they would
recover sufficiently by the morning to enable us to descend
again until we found some more grass.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE LAST CAMP OF OUR TWELVE MULES.</p>
</div>

<p>
After unloading, we all sallied forth in different directions
in search of roots for making a fire, but none of us were
successful; all we could discover anywhere was the rhubarb
and other hardy plants that will exist in these desolate
high-lying places. Ever since the desertion of our muleteers
we had carried along with us the poles of the tents we had
discarded, so as to be prepared for a crisis of this description,
so although our search was in vain, we were able to
make sufficient fire to make tea with.
</p>

<p>
During our hunt for the firewood heavy clouds had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
gathering, and occasional showers had made themselves
unpleasant. As soon as we had all returned a steady rainfall
set in. Our mules had been picketed close to our little
tent, for fear of their straying after grass during the night.
Altogether our encampment at the top of this desolate pass,
some 17,000 feet high, presented a very forlorn picture.
Everything was wet or damp, and the poor mules stood
with drooping, dripping heads. Still we had hopes of a
frost setting in and the ground becoming hard for marching
over in the morning. Our two little cats even seemed to
feel our deplorable condition, for nothing would induce
them to eat any of the raw meat we were able to spare them.
</p>

<p>
Soon after sunset intense darkness came over everything,
and trusting for better fortune the following day, we soon
fell asleep. During the night Malcolm happened to go outside
the tent, and then returned to rouse me, saying that he
thought some of the mules were dead. At first I could
scarcely realize or grasp his meaning; a disaster of this
description seemed to me incredible. I came out with him,
and found six of the twelve lying down as though they were
dead. Although it had ceased to rain, there were no stars
visible, and the night was still and damp. We roused the
men, who brought the candle lantern, and we discovered the
astounding truth. Four of them lay stiff and dead—poor
brutes! they had done yeoman service for us. Two others
were very nearly dead; but even with the united efforts of
all six of us we could get neither of them to stand up for a
single minute, and they soon followed the fate of the other
four.
</p>

<p>
A drizzling rain now set in, as by the light of the lantern
we set about dragging the carcasses aside and removing their
blankets to place on the survivors. Beyond this, we could
do nothing more but wait for daylight. Then more disaster
was added to our sad plight, for another mule died, and we
doubted whether there would be any to survive this black
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
night. We concluded that they must have eaten some
poisonous plant, for their bellies became distended, they lost
all power in their legs, and their groans were pitiable to
hear. Our survivors consisted of four mules and one pony,
and we now had to set about reducing our baggage to five
loads. All that we could possibly do without had to be
abandoned—in fact, we only kept one little tent, our bedding,
guns, ammunition, and instruments. The two little wild
cats were left there to feed on the dead bodies, and should
certainly have thrived well. It was 11 o'clock before we
dared venture on a descent of the pass, for the ground had
become very heavy and sodden.
</p>

<p>
As we moved off we left a sad scene behind us; seven dead
carcasses lay there, and all kinds of things scattered about
everywhere. Although we selected the nullah that afforded
the best road, still at each step the poor mules sank into
the mud above their fetlocks, and sometimes they sank down
altogether, when the load had to be taken off, the animal
dragged out, and reloaded. We knew our march would have
to be a short one, and resolved to halt the moment we
reached any grass. But our misfortunes had not yet come
to an end, for, after going a short distance, our last pony
collapsed completely and died. Shortly afterwards, another
mule was added to the list. Three mules alone remained,
and we could not know but that they, too, at any moment
might die.
</p>

<p>
After we had gone about four miles, but only with the
greatest difficulty, we found a little, but good, grass growing
on the bank close by the stream which flowed down the
nullah we were following. We at once halted and unloaded
the three survivors, who were soon revelling in it. We
then sent back and fetched the things we had discarded
on the way, and set about re-arranging the remainder of
our baggage into three loads. We agreed, too, that all
should carry a load strapped like a knapsack on our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
backs, as well as a rifle and some ammunition, although
these latter we had been carrying the whole way. Luckily
we found the droppings of wild yak on this patch of grass,
so were able to make a fire.
</p>

<p>
Our little tent just admitted of our bedding being placed
on the ground with a box between as a table, while the men
rigged one up with some poles and shawls, and made themselves
very snug. Rain again fell that afternoon, and continued
to do so throughout the night, until a frost set in,
and the rain was changed to snow. We dared hardly think
of what was happening to the three mules which had been
left free to graze, for there was nowhere else to wander to.
At daylight we found the ground covered with four inches
of snow, which made us fear the worst. On going outside
we found, to our great joy, the three survivors had in no
way suffered throughout the night. We made up our minds
to husband their strength, and treat them with the greatest
care. We were certainly better off as regards grain than
we had ever been before, and, instead of driving the mules
any more, it was arranged that we should each take turns
in leading one. Thus we could pick out the firmer ground,
and very often assist the mule where he would otherwise
have gone blundering on.
</p>

<p>
As we left camp 83, a very reduced little party, but full of
hope, we found the going even heavier than it had been
the previous day, for the animals constantly collapsed in
the soft soil on the banks of the nullah; and we came to
the conclusion that we were taking too much strength out
of them in comparison with the ground we were actually
covering, and that, therefore, our wisest plan would be to
halt on the first grassy ground we might come to, and
there wait in hopes of the weather improving. We had
hardly gone two miles when we called a halt. We had
found some good grass, and plenty of onions. The sun,
too, began to shine, and we trusted we had come to an end
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
of the rain and snow, and that the ground would soon dry
up and admit of an early start the following morning.
We made a splendid fire with our old tent and bed-poles,
and cheered every one up with a good meal of venison and
fried onions.
</p>

<p>
Having thus well fortified ourselves, we shouldered our
guns and sallied forth in search of game and to explore
ahead for the morrow. We failed in finding anything to
shoot, but collected a few more flowers. Our best plan
appeared to be to follow the nullah alongside which we
had encamped.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ20">
A SERPENTINE RIVER—HUNGER—MARMOTS—A PLEASANT
CAMPING.
</p>

<p>
As we loaded up the next morning everything was shrouded
in a thick white mist, and the ground was white with frost.
The going was still very heavy, and the stream, which took
a winding course, had to be frequently crossed. It was
about ten yards broad, a foot or more deep, swiftly flowing,
and very cold.
</p>

<p>
As the mist lifted the day became warm, and the three
mules sank deeper than ever in the sodden ground. In
spite of all our efforts, we could only make seven miles' headway,
but at the same time we had been steadily descending.
</p>

<p>
On the banks we found good grass and plenty of onions.
I photographed our camp, now much reduced in size, and
afterwards set out barefooted down the stream on a journey
of exploration, and in the hopes of finding something to
shoot.
</p>

<p>
After paddling on for a short distance I found another
important looking stream join its forces with the one I was
following. This stream was of equal volume, and flowed in
from the north. It would have been impossible to travel
in a northerly direction, for the country was very mountainous
and barren, stretching eventually on to snow peaks.
After a time, I climbed a hill from which I could see there
was a third stream flowing into this one, coming from a
south-westerly direction. As far as I could judge, the river
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
after this flowed easterly between two ranges of hills. I
thought that if we could only follow it we were sure to
find game, and perhaps people. It struck me, too, that
perhaps it was the Chu Ma, the very river we were after.
Although I failed to find anything to shoot, I returned
to camp with my information, which we dilated upon and
argued over, so as to keep up the spirits of our men, and as
rain again set in, it was satisfactory that we had something
to fill all with expectation.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-183" id="i-183"></a>
<img src="images/i-183.jpg" width="428" height="573" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RUBY.</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A white mist again shrouded us as we continued down
the stream. Twice in the first five minutes we had to cross
this icy cold water, so snake-like was the course the river
took. The banks were too steep for the mules to have
marched along them. It was a trying time for them, indeed,
to be frequently crossing and recrossing the same stream,
whose water came over our knees. All the mules, too, at
different times collapsed in mid-stream, when the loads had
to be carried ashore by us. At such a crisis as this we had
no time to think of our little dog Ruby, who would always
follow bravely after us, and was sometimes nearly washed
away by the strong current. By the end of our march
everybody was wet and cold, and the baggage was soaked.
Luckily, the sun put in an appearance, and we were able
to dry all our belongings. The immense number of onions
that grew on the banks helped in no slight degree to feed
the party, for we had run out of meat. Malcolm and I,
therefore, set out in opposite directions to try and shoot
something. Although we saw some antelope, neither of us
had any success.
</p>

<p>
At this point where we had encamped, the stream took
a southern course, apparently bending east again afterwards.
We reckoned that we should cut off a corner by travelling
east, and meeting the stream again later on. When we did
get a chance of bettering our route, we seldom let it escape
us. We marched over an undulating, sandy, grassy plain,
a range of mountains a mile or so off running parallel on
our left. Suddenly we struck another nullah, furnished
with a stream equal in size to the one we had been following.
At the same moment the rain, which had been threatening,
poured without pity. We argued that it was better to
continue the march than to try and camp under such conditions.
We saw many tracks of kyang, which was all the
more tantalizing to our desire for meat. The only animal
we saw was a wolf.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At length we reached a corner where our original stream
joined the one we were marching along, and we found we
should have to cross this formidable body of water. We
could see a few hundred yards off on the other bank a high-lying
sandy spot to camp on, close to some green banks.
To reach this goal was no easy matter. The three mules
were getting very tired, so that two of them collapsed in
the middle of the stream. The sand, too, on the further
side was treacherous for a considerable distance.
</p>

<p>
By the time we had rescued our mules and carried our
baggage to a place of safety, the sun was again kind
enough to have another look at us. He was evidently displeased,
for his presence was replaced by a heavy downpour,
which continued for a couple of hours. Personally I lit my
pipe, and soon fell asleep, till, at 3 o'clock, the sun again
invited us to go forth to try and shoot some animal for
food. We were soon off on the prowl, but all I saw was a
white-headed vulture, a fox, and some sand grouse, and
Malcolm was equally without success. I saw, however, that
the stream meandered on sometimes between precipitous
banks, increasing in volume, and with this news we fortified
our men.
</p>

<p>
At sunset the weather looked angry, nor did it fall short
of its foreboding; a strong east wind set in, and heavy
rain fell throughout the night. We managed to keep ourselves
fairly dry, and slept in spite of the storm that raged.
</p>

<p>
On waking at daybreak the wind was still blowing hard,
but the rain had ceased—a real boisterous morning, when
the sea waves would have rolled in with a mighty roar, as
though to sweep away the very rocks. The river had
swollen considerably and flowed strong and deep, as though
on some errand of weighty importance. The water was
stained to a dull reddish colour. It was out of the question
for us to think of making an early march, for the ground
resembled a quagmire. We went to inspect the nullah, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
see whether it was possible to march along it; but further
on the river ran flush with the precipitous sides on either
hand, and soon disabused us of that idea.
</p>

<p>
About 2 o'clock we took a circuitous route over and round
some hills, hitting off the river again lower down. Yet we
still had to keep on the higher ground, crossing other troublesome
nullahs and numerous hills, following generally its
course. We had got to that stage of hunger when a little
bird we saw became a victim to our guns. All at once a
hare sprang up, but the indefatigable Ruby was after her,
and thus did us out of a valuable supply. We struggled on
with our loads on our backs, straggling one behind the
other, instead of maintaining a compact little body as was
our wont.
</p>

<p>
Still we were for ever on the look-out, when suddenly Esau,
who was blessed with a splendid eyesight, spotted away in
the grassy hills a moving black object, which we at once
concluded must be a yak. While Malcolm went off to slay
this meat for our suppers, followed by two of the men ready
to bring in the food, I and the other two set about pitching
camp.
</p>

<p>
All were instilled with fresh hope, and we collected a heap
of roots to make a good fire to cook the meat over. But
alas! we were all doomed to disappointment, for this moving
object proved to be a black bear, which made off before
Malcolm could even get near enough to fire at it. We could
do nothing more than reason that the sight of a bear
indicated that we must be nearer people. Besides, we had
seen and shot little birds, and even the common house fly
had paid us a visit. Each day, too, we had been gradually
descending. With such arguments we believed that help
was close at hand, and were buoyed up in hopes of it.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, the 17th August, was dull and gloomy;
and the men were in the same state. They were probably
feeling weak through want of meat, for the last three days
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
they had lived on nothing but tea, while we had been regaled
with Liebig and suchlike; still, in this we were most parsimonious,
for we feared we might even get to worse straits.
So careful were we that some of this was actually brought
through China, and handed over to a missionary. As I
marched on ahead I came to some sandy mounds, where
I shot a very tiny hare, but in the grassy hills on our
right hand I spotted a kyang, which Malcolm went after, but
failed to get. Around and about were droppings both of
yak and kyang, and we decided to camp here until we had
shot something.
</p>

<p>
It was amusing, indeed, to see the four men making a
square meal off the mite of a hare I had shot. Malcolm
and I, leaving them to enjoy their repast and repose, set out
in different directions in search of game, both breasting the
steep range of hills which ran down to the river, and at
the foot of which we had encamped. I carried a gun, a
rifle, a knife, and some rope, and was lightly clad, so I was
able to climb the highest peaks and spy into the most likely
places. Yet I could find no game, though there were many
tracks and many droppings.
</p>

<p>
I happened for a few moments to be taking shelter under
a rock from a storm of sleet, when I saw, sitting up below
me, some huge marmots. They were of an enormous
size, as large as men. I could resist watching them no
longer, for even a marmot is good food when one is hungry.
On making my way to them some fine hares got up, and,
thinking that the game in sight was better than the
marmots out of sight down below, I killed a couple of
them. This fusillade must have driven the monstrous
marmots home, for they never showed themselves again.
The holes down which they must have hidden were so large
that I could have crawled down them myself. The two
hares I strung together, and began to make my way homewards.
On the way a third hare was added to my bag,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
and I rejoiced to think how glad the men would be when
they saw me coming, laden with three fat hares, no light
burden. Luckily, my way over the hills was all downhill,
still I was very glad when our little camp came into
sight, but was surprised that I could see nobody moving
about, for I thought they would have been on the look-out,
and would have been watching for my coming.
</p>

<p>
Good news was in store for me, and I soon learnt that
Malcolm had been even more successful, for he had shot
a kyang. Two of the men had gone off to bring in some
of the meat, while the other two were making preparations
for a big fire and a big feast. In order to give the men
a chance of recovering themselves, we decided not to march
the following day until 1 o'clock. Luckily the night turned
out bright and clear, and we were able to take observations
for latitude. Consequently, by the time I lay down for
the night the hour was late. As I found myself falling
asleep, I heard the mingled and indistinct murmuring
of the men's voices, merry amidst their frying and their
stewing. They must have presented a very different plight
compared to their demeanour of the last few evenings.
They had been changed from a sad and despondent crew
into the happiest supper party in the world, only by means
of a little wild donkey's flesh.
</p>

<p>
Now, of course, their religious scruples as to whether the
animal had been hallaled or not, probably never entered
their heads. Real hunger or thirst will make men do a
great many things which nothing else on earth can.
During all this time the three mules were gaining strength
by the rest and the excellent pasture land.
</p>

<p>
We were up the next morning at 7 o'clock with a strong
west wind blowing. We set about collecting onions for
our breakfast, for one has no inclination to lie long in bed
which is represented by mother earth. The morning was
spent in feasting by the men, and in mapping by ourselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
We calculated we had just crossed the ninety-second degree
of longitude, and found our latitude to be 35° 11'. We
discovered that if we wished to follow the river any further,
we should have to cross to the other bank, for it was
impossible, with the precipitous hills, to march any longer
along the right bank on which we were.
</p>

<p>
The river flowed thigh deep with a swift current, and was
thirty yards broad. Nevertheless, by carefully choosing
the easiest crossing, and by loading the three mules lightly,
with only half the baggage at a time, we managed, by
making the double journey, to get the mules, ourselves,
and our baggage over without any mishap. This was
rather a long business, but once all on the other bank, we
had soon loaded up the three mules again, and continued
the descent, still following the river, all in good spirits.
Towards evening we halted close to where another stream
from the north joined the river we were following, and
knew it would be in store for us to cross the next morning.
We were struck by the appearance of the splendid green
grass that grew on the hillsides, and the whole country
in general seemed to be improving for the better. It looked
as though we had completely come to the end of bleak
regions and salt lakes, and that each day, as we should
continue our gradual descent, even a more pleasing country
was in store for us.

CHAPTER XV.

<p class="ch_summ">
SHOOTING—A TROUBLESOME MULE—A YAK CEMETERY—I CHASE
A KYANG—TENDER HEARTS—INSCRIBED STONES—LASSOO
AND SHUKR ALI SICK—AN ARDUOUS CROSSING.
</p>

<p>
After a frosty night, a still morning with a cloudless sky
favoured us as we started forth to cross the stream that
barred our way. It was no easy undertaking, for the
sand was deep and treacherous, and the stream was filled
with great lumps of floating ice. Some time was spent in
these aquatic operations, for the mules sank deep into the
water and had to be unloaded. Two fine gulls flew overhead,
affording an easy shot for our guns and food for the party.
</p>

<p>
We made a double march to-day, and in the afternoon
pursued our course along the sandy bed of the river, congratulating
ourselves upon the firm level going. Presently,
the river made a bend, so that if we wanted to stick to the
bed, it became necessary to recross it. On sounding the
bottom for this purpose we found it far too treacherous
to dream of doing so. On first inspection of the banks of
the river it seemed as though we should have to retrace
our steps, for they looked too steep for climbing up. Still,
we found that, owing to the soft nature of the sand, we
were able to reach the top by marching in a slanting
direction. By taking our time we at length reached the
grassy plains above, and decided for the future to stick
to them, instead of the uncertain bed of the river.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th August we found we were again running
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
out of meat, and decided whenever we saw anything to
shoot that one of us should go after it, and if successful,
that the caravan should at once halt. The country was
favourable for game, so we had but little doubt that we
should soon supply our wants. Such proved to be the case,
for Malcolm shot a kyang, and we were all soon making a
square meal.
</p>

<p>
We were ready for a second march in the afternoon,
but were caught in a violent storm. We could see no
distance ahead of us. We could not have halted and
pitched our camp; we could not have found any shelter.
To have halted would have meant frozen limbs. There
was nothing to do but to face the storm and make what
headway we could. As soon as the weather had abated,
we found our way down to the river, and halted in a nook
sheltered by the steep banks.
</p>

<p>
We all felt convinced that with so much grass and
water people must be at hand. It was therefore arranged
that Malcolm and Esau should go on ahead with knapsacks,
rifles, and a good supply of meat, while I should follow on
as quickly as I could with the other three men and the
three mules, and still keep up the surveying. All set to
work to make a big fire for cooking a large supply of
wild donkey flesh to take on their journey. We were all
busy with the preparations, and full of hopes for the
venture of the morrow. It was arranged that the two
adventurers should have a substantial breakfast before
starting. Disappointment on this occasion was in store
for us. Rain and sleet greeted us at dawn, and fell
incessantly till midday. At that hour we fastened on the
two knapsacks, and Malcolm and Esau set forth in search
of people. We had arranged that both parties should keep
on the north side of the river, so that there could be no
danger of our losing one another.
</p>

<p>
As soon as these two had gone, I and the remainder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
struck camp, and made preparations to march too. Again
rain began to fall even heavier than before, and to add to
our troubles, one of the three mules refused to be caught
and loaded. Two whole hours did we waste in this soaking
rain in our endeavours to catch this most obstinate, aggravating,
yet clever mule. Then I felt that, as the day was
drawing to a close, our wisest plan was to leave the animal
victorious, and own ourselves beaten. I therefore gave
orders to unload and pitch the camp again. Every one and
everything was wet through, and just as we had fixed up
our little shelter, Malcolm and Esau returned. The weather
was altogether too intolerant, and they, like ourselves, had
on this day to give in to the inevitable. We both agreed
that the day was not quite good enough to start on. All
we could do was to lie down and endeavour to keep warm,
an impossibility, for everything was damp. We reaped
some comfort in conjuring up thoughts of other snug
places where all was warmth and sunshine.
</p>

<p>
After dark, as the rain had nearly ceased, we both went
to the men's tent, where they had managed to keep themselves
warmer than we had by means of a fire. Certainly
the smoke was blinding, but what did that matter? We
brought with us our store of brandy, and were soon cheerful
under its influence with hot water. We talked to the men
of boats and trains, of towns and other countries, so that
they might know what sights were awaiting them as soon
we had crossed this uninhabited land.
</p>

<p>
A dull, quiet morning succeeded this stormy weather.
The two men again set forth, while I followed with the rest.
As we proceeded we discovered we had marched into a
<i>cul de sac</i>. On our right hand our road was blocked by the
river, now increased to double its size. In front of us
stretched a fine fresh-water lake, while on our left an arm of
this lake lay, covering a distance of some miles to our rear.
There was, under these circumstances, no alternative left.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
I should either have to cross this arm or march back all the
way round it. The first plan I attempted, but to no purpose,
for the soil of the lake was too soft. I had, therefore, to
begin a retrograde march. I felt lucky that the mules had
not been lost altogether in the arm of the lake, as seemed
probable at one time, so was less bitter against having to
march in a westerly direction. Everywhere on the banks
of this lake grew magnificent green grass, and there were
signs of many yak. By the edges of this shallow freshwater
lay innumerable bones and scores of very fine heads
and skeletons of dead yak. It seemed as though they all
came to die by the shore of this wonderful lake.
</p>

<p>
I halted the little party in a garden of vegetables, and
having made a meal off the last piece of the wild donkey,
set out in search of game, but only bagged a couple of fat
hares. About here I noticed large carrion birds, generally
a sign that people are living in the neighbourhood.
Enjoying the lake, too, were a multitude of various white
birds, mostly in the middle of it.
</p>

<p>
It was my wish to start early, but the ground was white
with snow at daybreak. In consequence, as we marched
along the edge of the lake, the going was of the heaviest.
A kyang came trotting up to see what we were after.
Unfortunately, I only broke his foreleg, for, although I
chased him for a very long way, he was still able to evade
my shots and escape. It was satisfactory to find oneself
marching east again. I at length pitched camp close to
the water's edge, opposite my camp of the day before, on
the other side of the arm.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the storm which had broken over us had
passed off, I climbed the grassy hills that bordered the
north shore of the lake, to shoot some food. I crept close
up to two yak and wounded one of them, and chased him
till the approaching darkness and a violent storm warned
me it was time to return. I cared not how it rained, for I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
was angry and vexed with myself at having in one day
wounded two harmless animals, and at the same time at
having provided no food for the party.
</p>

<p>
As I made my way homewards along and down the steep
grassy slopes, I saw another kyang, and, to fill up the cup
of anguish, I wounded him, even with my last round of
ammunition. Although in this condition he could not travel
fast, still he could evade my getting near him. By exerting
myself to the utmost, I found I could not only keep him in
sight, but could drive him in the direction I wanted. It
flashed across my mind, what if I could actually drive the
poor kyang as far as the camp, where he would be caught,
and oceans of meat would be provided for all, without the
trouble of having to fetch it? Then on looking round I
knew that darkness would end the chase, for camp was some
miles off. As I pursued the kyang, or rather drove him,
he entered a steepish nullah, down which a stream flowed,
and by the side of this he succumbed. I rushed up with
mixed feelings of joy and pity, and before he could struggle
to his feet I had plunged my knife into him. At the
same moment a deafening storm of thunder and lightning
broke over me, and darkness followed.
</p>

<p>
For fear of losing my way I kept to the nullah, which
finally emerged by the edge of the lake, along whose banks
I trudged till, eventually, a dim light from the men's tent
showed me where the camp was. Shortly after my arrival
the storm passed off and the moon shone out. The men
were hungry, and when I narrated my adventures, two of
them, arming themselves with knives and a sack, set out
under the lucid instructions I gave them to find the kyang
and bring in some of the flesh. I had slept soundly before
I was aroused again by the arrival of the hissing frying
pan into my tent, alive with fresh meat and wild onions.
</p>

<p>
The morning after these storms was still, as though the
elements had exhausted themselves. The lake resembled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
a large sheet of the smoothest glass, partially hidden by
some light clouds that rested on it, awaiting a breath of
wind or the sun's rays before they could be lifted. As I
walked along the edge of the water I shot four hares, for in
some of the rocky places they were plentiful enough.
</p>

<p>
Although I had hit off a well-defined track frequented by
wild animals, still the sandy soil was so laden with moisture
that the mules sank deep at almost every step. The lake,
by reason of its sandy and rocky shore, reminded me more
of an inlet sea than anything else. Then grassy slopes
with flowers and vegetables eventually rose into high hills,
which again were backed by snow-capped peaks. On the
south side of the lake a vast plain extended to distant
mountains. In whatever direction I chanced to look numbers
of wild yak and kyang could be seen grazing, while
on the lake itself many water-fowl had found a home. It
was a veritable sportsman's or artist's paradise.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the mules were tired, I halted and went off to
shoot a yak. A yak was always preferable to a kyang, for
there was more fat to be got from the body. I soon found
one above camp and had but little difficulty in shooting
him. Having loaded myself with a sack of meat I descended
again to camp. On arrival, to my surprise, Malcolm and
Esau had returned. They had had, in fact, enough of
trying to find people in stormy weather, when they had not
even been able to light a fire. They, however, gave good
reports of the road ahead, which they said would still bring
us to abundance of grass teeming with yak, at the same
time gradually descending.
</p>

<p>
This afternoon the three mules unfortunately strayed,
and we turned into bed without even knowing where they
had gone to. It seemed as though they were tired of
carrying heavy loads over sodden ground and were bent
upon a little pleasure of their own. One of the three mules
invariably used to give us a deal of trouble in catching him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
for loading up. We found the only way of securing the
rascal was for two of us to hold a long rope at both ends,
allowing it to lie flat on the ground. Then the rest of us
would drive the mule towards the rope, which was tightened
as he reached it. Then those who held the two ends would
run round in opposite directions, and thus encircle the
animal in the coils. This plan, however, took up so much
time and energy that eventually we used to fasten the mule
with a long rope to one of the other two, when there was
no difficulty in catching him. Of course, when his load
was on, he made no attempt at escaping, but rather the
reverse, for he would thrust himself forward as much as
to say, "Just take off these things, please, and let's be off."
He was a wonderfully clever mule, and the most useful one
we had. Although small, he used to carry 400 pounds
weight of baggage, about the equal of what the other two
carried together.
</p>

<p>
After we had tracked the three wandering mules, who
had selected a cosy nook, well concealed from view, we
continued our march along the edge of the lake. Hares,
terns, and gulls fell to our guns, and at night-time we
camped by a garden of onions and rhubarb. Although this
wonderful lake was a charming and delightful spot, with a
genial climate, still we were not sorry on the 26th August
to reach the eastern corner of it. Here we found sandy,
hillocky ground, with good grass, a favourite haunt of the
kyang.
</p>

<p>
A short distance from the lake we were lucky enough to
strike another small stream, that took its rise from some of
the neighbouring hills. This stream flowed away in an
easterly direction, sometimes sluggish, at others fairly fast.
The water was clear with sandy bottom, a few yards across,
and only about a foot deep. In some places we could see
numbers of tiny fish, which always made off at our approach.
The banks of this little stream were sandy and grassy. All
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
were delighted at having hit upon this sign of civilization.
We decided, whatever happened, to follow it. By so doing
we knew we must be descending the whole time, and what
was more important still, we knew we should never suffer
from scarcity of water. There would be, as well, always
more chance of finding game and grass. We made a double
and pleasant march along the stream, which all the time
was increasing in volume, but at night-time we were almost
beaten down by a heavy thunder-storm.
</p>

<p>
The next day we left the river, hitting it off again before
halting. During the night the mules once more strayed,
and prevented us from marching the following morning.
Perhaps they had been taking shelter from another storm
that had visited us. As the morning was fine we were not
in the best frame of mind at having to wait till they were
found. Yet we had plenty to do in writing, and mapping,
and cleaning all our guns, etc. As we marched off in the
afternoon, I was ahead carrying my shot-gun, and suddenly
came close upon a goa. Although he was stung with No. 2
shot, he unfortunately managed to escape into the grassy
hills. That evening another storm broke over us, just as
we were flattering ourselves that we had escaped.
</p>

<p>
A yak probably carries his heart very low, for most of
those which were shot received the bullet just behind the
shoulder, yet on opening the dead body, we never found
any wound inflicted on the heart itself. We were glad that
the yak was provided with such internal arrangements, for
the heart was the tit-bit of the animal. It was so tender
that it could always be eaten directly after death. The
kidneys were excellent, the liver was fair, and the tongue
as tough and as hard as wood, according to our way of
curing it. The probability is that, with proper means, the
tongue would have been the most toothsome bit of any.
The flesh itself was, as a rule, tough, even after several
days' keeping, and was never as tender as the flesh of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
kyang, but although close-grained, it was very sound,
nutritious meat.
</p>

<p>
The choicest part of the wild donkey was its heart. I
fancy the flesh of this animal, when we had stored it up for
several days, had more flavour to it, a flavour, too, which
was peculiar to the animal itself. As for antelope and goa,
every particle of flesh was juicy and tender, and was always
eagerly devoured by us all.
</p>

</div>

<p>
On the 29th August, when we vowed our three mules
were worth their weight in gold, for with heavy loads they
plodded most pluckily through the sodden soil, and over
nasty, deep, stony nullahs, I happened to be walking on
higher ground along the side of hills. I had my shot-gun
and was after hares, for we were all very fond of them.
Quite by chance I came upon the first sign of man's work.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
I had found a māné. A māné is a heap of stones, consisting
of only a few or of thousands, upon which are inscribed
sacred sayings. They are common all over the country,
wherever Tibetans live. This particular māné consisted of
three stones placed edgeways in the ground, and forming
three sides of a square. Resting on these was a fourth
stone, and they all bore inscriptions. This was a great
find, and I shouted and waved to Malcolm and the men
below, two of whom were soon eagerly making their way
towards me to learn the news.
</p>

<p>
All were buoyed up with hope of soon meeting people,
and when we halted after our first march, all were full of
suggestions and expectations, and looked forward to once
more getting some flour, mutton, salt, sugar, and butter.
In two days at the most we calculated nomads would be
found.
</p>

<p>
On one green hill we could see hundreds upon hundreds
of yak grazing; there was, I believe, more yak visible than
hill. We were particularly partial to these animals, for
the reason already given on a previous page. The fat of
the yak was so precious to us that we used to boil down
every ounce of it, and put it into our old cocoa tins.
These cakes of yak's fat were very much appreciated by
all. We used to knock off bits of it and eat it as if it were
Everton toffy.
</p>

<p>
We found that to cross the river would have been
hazardous, but we discovered that, after winding round to
the left, it made a sharp bend to the right again, and at
this point rose up precipitous cliffs, forming the basis of
high hills. We should, therefore, either have to go round
or over these hills. The former would have taken days,
and probably have led us out of our depth altogether.
In such a situation we had no choice, and commenced to
climb them.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of our difficulty, another of those violent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
storms fell on us, accompanied with hail, that was blown
painfully against man and beast. It was impossible to
struggle on against such adversity—a stiff ascent and a
blinding storm. Even this came to an end, when we slowly
breasted the hill again. By nightfall we had come out
victorious; we had descended again the other side, and
had encamped close to the river. We knew, though, that
we were not sufficiently strong to overcome many more
obstacles such as we had just surmounted. A wet morning
of mist and rain followed this event. When we were able,
we marched off again along the banks of the river till we
found it was joined by another river coming from the north.
This we had to cross with care.
</p>

<p>
On the other side, some distance off, I saw a yak, and set
out ahead to shoot it. I wounded him grievously, and
feeling certain that he would not go very far, I waited for
the caravan to arrive, so that a man could come after
me to bring along some meat. He gave me a longer chase
than I had anticipated, but the last bullet told, when he
rolled over on his back and kicked violently with all fours
in his final struggles. He was a very fine fellow, as the
man with me remarked, "<i>Pahar ke muafic</i>" (like a mountain),
and his horns were over three feet long.
</p>

<p>
Laden with meat, I walked on in search of our camp,
and was beginning to get a little uneasy at not having seen
any signs of which way they had gone, for the sun was
setting, when two very faint shots announced their whereabouts.
That night we fared sumptuously, for Malcolm
too had slain a yak near camp, as he thought it quite
possible that the one I had gone after might have escaped
altogether, which would have meant no supper.
</p>

<p>
We were aroused early by moans from Lassoo. We found
him lying on his back and groaning, and argued that he
must have been suffering from indigestion. We had been
anxious to make an early start, but Lassoo's sickness and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
a thick, wetting mist quickly dispelled this wish. By midday
Lassoo was relieved by administering warm flannel
and Cockle's pills, and the mist, too, by the cheering sun.
On the march I shot a goa with my shot-gun. He was
very tame, never attempting to run away more than twenty
yards from me. Later on two yak came charging down
upon our caravan, within fifteen yards. Had they come
much nearer we should have had to shoot them in self
defence; yet we had no wish to, for we had abundance
of meat for the time being, as much as we could manage
to carry.
</p>

<img src="images/i-201.jpg" width="542" height="427" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN ENORMOUS YAK.</p>
</div>

<p>
Although Colonel Prjevalsky writes that "wild yak
shooting is as dangerous as it is exciting, for a wounded
beast, especially an old bull, will often attack the pursuer,"
yet, personally speaking, I never found a yak attempt to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
charge, wounded or not, and consider there to be absolutely
no more danger in shooting a yak than an antelope.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening, when we were thinking of calling a
halt, we found another important river running in from
the north, and which we should have to cross. We elected
to do so that same evening, for we doubted being able to
get the men to face the icy water the first thing in the
morning. Both Lassoo and Shukr Ali were sick, so we
only had Shahzad Mir and Esau to help us.
</p>

<p>
In first attempting to find a crossing, the current carried
me off my legs, for the water was waist deep at this spot.
By making more trials we found we could manage higher
up the river, by crossing in a diagonal direction with the
current. Here the river was twenty-five yards across, with
the water up to the thighs, and the bed was uneven with
big boulders.
</p>

<p>
These operations took some time, for, fearing accidents,
we had to make double journeys. Worst of all was the cold
north wind, that blew without pity. It was chilly work, to
say the least of it, and when all had reached the green turf
on the other bank, we all felt we could never have crossed
that river again, not even for a sack of sovereigns!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
ANOTHER CHULA—MOUNTAINS—A QUEER ILLUSION—STRANGE
VOICES—WE FIND WE ARE DESCENDING—A TIBETAN CAMP—ESAU
SENT AS AN AMBASSADOR—AN INVITATION.
</p>

<p>
The 1st of September was a dull morning with a very
biting east wind, but our two invalids had been cured by
means of Cockle's, and all of us felt relieved when we woke
up to find we were on the right side of the river. I am afraid
that our two sick men would not have recovered, had we
delayed the crossing of the torrent the evening before.
During our morning's march we kept close to the river's
edge, which now flowed by majestically. In the latter half
of the day the travelling was bad and toilsome, over a white,
stony soil, abounding in unexpected quagmires, and enticing
us further on to spongy, sloping ground, sliced up by
innumerable nasty ragged nullahs. Even in this inhospitable
stretch of land Lassoo found a hope of further
good tidings in the shape of a chula, or mountain fireplace,
apparently a month or two old.
</p>

<p>
Close to the river we quite unexpectedly hit upon a
beautifully grassy spot, sheltered by some green hillocks from
the incessant wind. It promised at sunset to turn out a
bright, clear night, so as to afford us a chance of taking
some latitudes, but clouds again began to gather around
and eventually obscured every star, and produced a dim yet
penetrating rain. This at daybreak was replaced by snow.
Still we loaded up, and struggled along against the storm of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
snow and sleet that blew against our faces and impeded our
progress. Later on the sun forced a way through the
unkindly clouds, and the snow was quickly melted into
the soil. All our labour in drying our baggage was wasted,
for everything was soaked with rain again as soon as we
began our second march, over a country alternating with
patches of grass and white stones. It was an impossibility
to see for any distance, but we steered by the noise from
the swollen river, till, just before dusk, all became clear
again. Then we learnt the cause of the icy wind that had
been persecuting us. There rose up north and north-east
of us, forty or fifty miles away, some lofty, snow-capped
mountains, a truly magnificent picture to gaze upon. A
sunny morning was an agreeable change for us, and, added
to the fine sight of the snows, compensated for the sterile
and monotonous plains of white stones over which we
continued our march.
</p>

<p>
The only life we saw was a large gathering of sand-grouse.
So confident were we of shooting a sumptuous meal, that as
we drew near to these birds we began to reckon how many
of them our four barrels would account for. They, too,
must have had their share of reckoning, for without giving
us a chance, they with one accord took to wing and flew
high and far away, irritating us with their well-known notes.
</p>

<p>
After proceeding for about four miles we came to a large
heap of stones, conspicuous in this flat, open plain. It was
an indication of man's presence at some time or other.
There was no writing on any of the stones. From here we
descended to a lower level in the bed of the river. On one
of the adjacent hills I had noticed, through my glasses,
actually a man with a little dog. Look as often as we
might, still there was no mistaking their identity, yet we
could scarcely realise the fact.
</p>

<p>
Whilst the meat was being prepared for breakfast, I went
off to interview the stranger. The nearer I came the more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
was I convinced that there really stood a man and his dog.
Suddenly they disappeared from view, and fearing their
escape I hastened my step, which soon brought me to within
an easily recognisable distance, when, on the man with his
little dog again showing themselves, I learnt that they were
no other than two marmots.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast we heard what sounded like men shouting
from the other side of the river. We all turned our
eyes in the direction from whence it came, and, in spite of
getting a good view, nothing was visible. We speculated
as to what could possibly be the cause of the noise, for all
had heard it, and, as is usual on these occasions, were none
the wiser in the end. The only result was that there was
considerable excitement amongst our little party. I have
read of travellers hearing strange voices when traversing
some of the deserts of Turkistan. Perhaps some of these
phantoms who emitted those remarkable noises had wandered
over into Tibet.
</p>

<p>
The monotonous plain we marched over in the afternoon
seemed interminable, making the men wearier than
the animals, for the going was firm and level. As soon as
we had pitched our camp, clouds gathered around us from
every quarter, and at length burst open with a violent
thunderstorm. At such times we could do nothing more
than lie down in our tent, and try to keep dry and look
pleasant.
</p>

<p>
The day before yesterday the men had told us that they
had meat left for five more days. We did not, therefore,
trouble about shooting any of the kyang that happened to
come and look at our camp, or to stalk any of the antelope
we saw. After the storm had abated, they came to inform
us that the meat was finished, not an uncommon state of
affairs with us. It shows how difficult it was to provide
for such unreasonable men, worthy as they were in most
other respects.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We were beginning to think that, as we had marched so
long and so far without seeing any living being, we must be
the only people in existence. To any one who is anxious
to avoid the police authorities, I can strongly recommend
the Chang.
</p>

<p>
On the 4th of September we learnt from our own observations
that we were actually at a lower altitude than Niagzu
is, where we had last seen brushwood. We had unmistakably
been descending ever since the great disaster befell our
animals. After we had made our midday meal off the
scrapings of a yak's tail we had carried for some days, and
the carcass of a hare, we moved on again, still traversing
the same kind of country.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening we found an old chula close by the
river side, and, at no great distance from here, the ground
whereon only a few months previously there must have
been a fairly large encampment of nomads or merchants.
From traces we found round and about, it was evident the
caravan had consisted of camels and ponies; there were
even the remains of a dead pony close by. We found the
single horn of an antelope stuck into the ground, which
was a convincing proof that the owners had possessed firearms.
We saw also some pieces of string and odds and
ends, which our men, of course, picked up. The caravan
had evidently marched along the river we were following,
for further on we found more camel droppings, but as to
who they were and whence they had come from and
where they were going, it was impossible to say. They
benefited our little party by putting every one in the most
hopeful and cheery frame of mind. Here were we at
inhabitable altitudes, and we had seen unmistakable signs
that told us that other people, too, had travelled in this part
of the land.
</p>

<p>
There was much rain during the night. After loading
up, Malcolm and I, separating, went ahead to do our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
best to shoot some meat. Malcolm luckily wounded a
kyang, and drove the animal to the spot where we had
halted. His heart was soon cut out and hissing with the
onions in the frying pan, and all fared sumptuously. We
carried away sufficient donkey flesh to last our party three
days, and proceeded over the same monotonous plain, which
later on was relieved by some sandy hillocks. The men's
spirits were kept from falling through the discovery of some
more chulas. This encouraged them to weather the storm
that enveloped us.
</p>

<p>
During the night at Camp 107 our mules had strayed,
so that on the morning of the 6th of September all idea of
making a double march had to be abandoned, especially
as there was a steady downfall of rain. It was, in fact,
11 o'clock before we were able to make a start, and at
that hour a cold wind was blowing from the northern snows,
and the day was altogether dull, heavy, and depressing; it
awakened us to the realisation of our actual feelings. We
became aware that we needed some little luxury, such as
flour and salt. We seemed to be having rather a surfeit of
our finds of wild donkey's flesh.
</p>

<p>
More than four months had elapsed since we had gaily
cantered out of Leh post-haste. We longed to find somebody,
and we would willingly have given a large sum for
a loaf of bread. We wondered how it was that while our
four men had of late been always nagging and quarrelling
with one another over every little trifle, we ourselves had
never disagreed for a minute. Our only solution was that
there was nothing at all we could have argued about, for
both our minds were bent heart and soul on the same
object, namely, the accomplishment of what we had undertaken
to do.
</p>

<p>
As we had seen signs of mankind, we began to talk over
plans. We decided that when we reached a locality
abounding in game, to leave three men and one mule
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
there, and ourselves, with the other man and two mules,
lightly loaded, to make enormous marches, and find people
and bring back assistance with the greatest possible expedition.
Thus, filled with these thoughts, both of the past
and of the future, we continued our march in silence, so
gloomy was the day. The daily practice of exploring on
ahead had made the work of always keeping a sharp look
out in front, to right and left of our route, habitual to
us all.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, in the dull light, I noticed far down the river,
on the stretch of pasture lands that extended to the hills
on the other side, something of whitish appearance. This
at first, by means of our glasses, we made out to be a
number of stone houses. Yet the idea seemed so ridiculous
to us that we declared it was only some irregularities of the
ground, such as we had often seen before, and conjured up
into no end of impossible resemblances.
</p>

<p>
The dull, gloomy day had doubtless made us less sanguine
of help than we usually were. Nevertheless, we still kept
our eyes on the thing, and halted every three or four
hundred yards to inspect again with our glasses, but only
to repeat once more, "Merely irregularities of the ground."
At length we reached a piece of rising ground, where
another inspection produced the words, "Merely irregularities,"
and, "Stop a moment! Some one else have a look,"
I called, as I held out my glasses for the nearest man to
take, stating, "I think it must be something else than
'merely irregularities of the ground.'"
</p>

<p>
The first man gazed intently, removed the glasses from his
eyes, and passed them to another, still keeping his eyes fixed
on these "irregularities of the ground." Thus we all looked
and gazed, and all were astounded, for some could even
discern smoke rising from the spot. We moved on quickly
another few hundred yards, full of excitement, and suggesting
a thousand problems in a very short time. Once more we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
halted and repeated our observations. Now the smoke was
as clear as a pike-staff, and, what was still more astounding,
we could actually solve the question of the "irregularities
of the ground." These, indeed, we made out to be tents,
and if there was a doubt it was soon dispelled by our
noticing a short distance from the tents an immense number
of animals, which we conjectured to be yak. We put two
and two together and agreed with ourselves that the tents
formed a large encampment, and the animals dotted about
were the transport.
</p>

<p>
But our next question was, "By whom could they be
inhabited? " The tents were certainly white, and we knew
the tents of ordinary nomads were black. Was it an
encampment of the Golok, or other robber tribes? Surely,
we said, they have black tents too? Was it a Russian
caravan travelling from Turkistan? Could it by any possible
chance be some other travellers' camp, like ourselves,
but on a much larger scale? Were they a body of Turkistan
merchants? Then, again, we reflected that their tents would
probably be black. We could not help thinking there must
be some European dwelling in them. Whatever they might
turn out to be, we decided to waste no more time in useless
speculation, but to resort to action.
</p>

<p>
We decided on the following plan:—We sent Esau,
because he could speak Tibetan well, with Shukr Ali,
because he was of least use to us, armed with rifles, to
cross the river and reconnoitre the camp, find out who
they might be, and, if possible, bring back food and help.
We ourselves, with Shahzad Mir and Lassoo, continued the
march along the river till opposite the encampment, which
lay a mile or so back from it. We then selected a hollow,
surrounded by high rocks, and with good grass around,
to pitch our camp on, completely out of sight of those on
the other side of the river.
</p>

<p>
Thus we were thoroughly prepared for any emergency
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
that might occur. From our position we could take note
of their every movement without being seen ourselves.
While each of us watched in turn from the summit of the
rocks, which we called our battlements, the rest were busy
with the usual duties connected with pitching a camp or
bivouac. We saw that our two men had safely crossed the
river, and watched them getting nearer and nearer to the
camp, till darkness hid them from our view.
</p>

<p>
As the night was dark and our two men had been explicitly
told where they would find us, and as it was highly probable
that the strangers opposite had no idea at all of our
existence, we saw no reason why we should keep watch
throughout the night. We certainly kept awake a later hour
than usual, chiefly, I think, in the expectation of Esau
turning up with a loaf of bread or some other food—for
Esau is a shrewd, cunning fellow—whilst our conversation
consisted merely of repeating our conjectures as to who
these people might be, and what might be happening to
our two men. With a gnawing feeling at the pit of our
stomachs, which we thought might have been satisfied,
we fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Snow was on the ground when we anxiously rose the next
morning, glasses in hand, to mount the battlements and
watch. We found the previous day that with glasses we
could just distinguish and count the tents, and with difficulty
make out men. At first I could distinguish nothing of the
strange camp, and merely put this down to the fact that it
was not yet full daylight. Still I kept on straining and
straining my eyes as the day grew brighter, yet I could see
nothing.
</p>

<p>
So remarkable did it seem to me that I called Malcolm.
Neither could he distinguish any signs of the camp up or
down the river. We stood astounded, and somewhat crestfallen.
What could have happened to the tents, and where
were our two men, we asked over and over again? All our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
hopes, raised so high, of seeing people once again, and of
getting food, were all of a sudden cruelly shattered. Yet
surely, we argued, if there had been no tents, and our
certainty, after all, was only an illusion, what could have
happened to our two men? Had they been swept away in
trying to recross the river, or were they lying ill behind
some rock? It was impossible for us to know, and we
resolved to wait and watch for them the whole day, and
then, if there were no signs of them, to continue our march
down the river bank, for we could not say how many more
or how few days we might hold out without getting any
help.
</p>

<p>
We were more surprised than ever to see two men, about
10 o'clock, trudging along up stream on the same side of the
river as ourselves, and before very long were glad to recognise
them. To judge from the way they were walking, we
guessed they had good news for us, and such proved to
be the case. We were all soon eagerly listening to their
adventures.
</p>

<p>
Esau related how this encampment proved to be a joint
one of Tibetan merchants on their way from Lhassa to
China, and how he had been taken to the tent of the head
merchant, where he had received hospitality, and slept
the night. Esau had been primed with a story to tell that
we were a merchant and a doctor on our way to China.
The merchant had at once recognised Esau as coming from
Ladakh, and, on hearing his story, he remarked they must
be either English or Russians, for, he said, men of no other
nations could accomplish such a journey. Then Esau
related the whole truth, detailing how matters stood with
us. At the mention of rupees the merchant pricked up his
ears, and expressed his desire to see us and do a little
business by selling us food. In order to gain his friendship
Esau had told him we had nothing else but bags of rupees,
while as a matter of fact we had only something like four
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
hundred. Esau also accounted for the miraculous vanishing
of the entire encampment. He said that before daybreak
they had marched off along the river, which they had crossed
lower down, and thence were going to travel on to Barong
and Tankar on the Chinese border. The merchant had
sent his salaam, and advised us to follow in his tracks and
catch up his caravan, for he said he was most anxious
to make our acquaintance. This plan suited us admirably,
for we, like the merchant, were steering for Barong and
Tankar. We pictured to ourselves the friendship and
hospitality that awaited us, and anticipated overtaking the
caravan that same evening, and the enjoyment of a cosy
tent and a good supper, for Esau had told us he carried all
kinds of supplies.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
WE CATCH UP THE MERCHANT'S CAMP—TIBETAN HOSPITALITY—WE
FIND THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED THE SOURCE OF
THE CHU MA—BARGAINING.
</p>

<p>
It can well be imagined that we were not long in loading up
our three mules, and were soon marching faster than was
our wont down the banks of the river. Still, as we covered
mile after mile, we were growing disappointed at finding
no tracks of the caravan, especially, too, as from any high
mounds that afforded a far-stretching view, we could see no
signs of any camp at all. We began to lose heart and to
fear the whole affair was a myth. We wondered whether
the merchant had been deceiving Esau. Just then, as our
doubts had become really serious, we reached the place where
the caravan had crossed the river.
</p>

<p>
The merchant had certainly given good advice, and easy
to follow, in telling us to overtake him by means of his
tracks. They were clearly seen and numberless in the soft
sandy soil; it seemed as though a whole army had swept
along. By the water's edge was a mud pile two feet high,
decorated with a stick on top. We were convinced that
it was a landmark to point out to merchants where to
cross in safety. Here we had to leave the river, which
we had been following for nearly twelve days from
its very source. We kept to the tracks of the merchant,
expecting every moment to come upon the encampment.
Our three mules were beginning to show signs of fatigue,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
and as sunset was close at hand we were reluctantly compelled
to halt for the night without the fulfilment of our
hopes. We were a little anxious and disappointed, for
we argued that if the merchant always marched like this,
we should never be able to catch him up.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, the 8th September, we tried hard
to come in sight of the merchant. The tracks took us over
a steep pass of deep sand and a descent down to a fine
grassy valley, fed with a stream of clear bright water.
Close to this we found they had encamped the night before.
Here was the first good grass we had seen since leaving the
river, so it was clear the merchant had declined to halt until
he had reached a really good camping-ground, and we
reckoned that the chances were that the next march would
only be a short one.
</p>

<p>
We found the fires that had been lit were still burning,
the dried droppings or argols were still red-hot, and various
marks denoted where the different tents had been pitched,
and the yak and ponies picketed. Such preparations as
fire and water at hand induced us to halt for breakfast, and
after despatching this frugal meal, Malcolm, Esau and
myself, loaded with some rupees, which we had not set eyes
on for months, set out in front, determined to catch up the
merchants that very night, no matter how far they might
have gone. We could no longer stand this vanishing like
a will-o'-the-wisp. The other three men and three mules
were to follow on in their own time, making as long a march
as they could manage.
</p>

<p>
There was no difficulty in following the tracks, for we could
sometimes see miles a away a broad black-looking line over
damp grassy or deep sandy ground showing the route that
had been taken. We had a long though pleasant tramp
before us, mostly through grassy valleys, bounded on either
hand by fine ranges of hills. The sun had set, yet we were
able easily to distinguish the tracks, and finally, after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
turning the corner of a valley, we saw lights burning some
way off in some low-lying land, well sheltered by neighbouring
hills from the bitterly cold wind that was blowing.
</p>

<p>
As long as we continued on the move we did not suffer,
but a halt of a few minutes soon became unpleasant. After
an eighteen-mile walk we were within half a mile of the
tents, so we sent Esau on ahead, armed with one of our
Chinese visiting cards, to announce to the merchant that
we were outside, and were anxious to pay our respects to
him, and, if possible, do a little business in the shape of
food and hiring transport.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Esau had left us we quickly grew cold and
impatient, for we had expected he would have at once come
himself, or sent some one else, to bring us to the presence
of the merchant. We could stand it no longer; we were
famished with cold and hunger, and there lay the tents.
We had done our share of being polite by sending our
servant on in front. Why should we not go ourselves and
enter the merchant's tent without more formality? As we
drew near to the tents, the loud fierce barking of the big
dogs gave tidings of our approach. Hunger and cold made
us indifferent to these monsters, and had it not been for
the kindness and intelligence of a small boy, who saw us,
we might have had a very unpleasant time of it. With his
aid we at length found our way to the head merchant's
tent, where a dangerously fine-looking dog, luckily chained
up to the pole, by his angry growls soon brought the
merchant's servant from within. He must by this time
have heard all about our arrival, for without more ado
he beckoned to us to come inside the tent. We wanted no
second invitation to escape from the icy-cold north wind
that seemed to penetrate our very bones. We smiled with
unfeigned pleasure and delight as we entered this cosy
warm abode. On either side of the tent was a thick mattress,
covered with dull red cloth, and on the end of each of them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
sat a Tibetan merchant, clothed in dark red robes. At the
end of the tent was burning a gentle light, displaying his
religious articles of silver and other precious metals that
lay on a table—a light that was quite in accordance with
the surroundings of comfort and snugness. In the middle
of the tent was a fire of red-hot argols, glowing particularly
bright on this cold night, supporting a shining copper kettle
filled with tea.
</p>

<p>
At the end of one of the beds sat Esau, busily engaged in
filling his inner man; whilst able to satisfy his own wants
he seemed to have lost his senses and forgotten all about
his masters'. A few sharp words of reproof soon brought
him to his feet, and we were introduced to the two chief
Tibetans in the camp. They signed to us to be seated, and
then handed us a basin each, which the servant filled
with hot tea. Into this he dropped a large lump of butter,
and then held before us a large red leather bag, filled with
tsampa, or finely-ground barley meal. From this we took
several large spoonfuls and mixed up with the tea, adding
whatever salt we fancied. The merchant's servant then
handed us some chopsticks, and we were soon at work
shovelling the hot mixture into our mouths, rather greedily,
I'm afraid, and if I were to relate the number of basins
we emptied that night, it would never be credited.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we had somewhat satisfied the gnawings of our
hunger, we opened negotiations about purchasing supplies.
The prices far excelled our purses, and as everything was
packed up for their early march the next morning, no
business could be done in that line. The merchant informed
us that he only intended making a six-mile march, and he
consented to lend us two ponies for our baggage, that they
might help our three mules in reaching the camp the next
day. He said he would leave his servant with them, with
instructions that if our three mules did not arrive before
midday, he was to wait no longer, but come on without them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After thanking the two merchants for their hospitality,
we left the tent to go to the shelter where it had been
arranged we were to spend the night. We found ourselves
stumbling over picketing ropes and threading our way
amidst hosts of yak, till we drew up before a huge pile of
goods with a large awning stretched over them. We sat
down in the darkness by this mass of merchandise. Here
we found no shelter from the wind, and to have remained
there for any length of time would have been impossible;
such a bitterly cold wind we had never experienced before—besides,
we did not feel we were being treated with the
little respect we were entitled to. In our present condition
we could certainly not expect much, but here were we, two
Englishmen, chucked along with the baggage under an
awning, absolutely no shelter on a night like this, while
the two Tibetan merchants were sleeping peacefully in
warmth and comfort. We could withstand it no longer,
and rose to find our way back to the merchants' tent. They
had both gone to bed, but we informed them that we, too,
had come to sleep inside the tent, and at once began to
make ourselves at home. The merchants, though surprised
at our intrusion, still were not in a frame of mind to object
to our company. Either they had some pity for us on this
bitter night, or more probably, owing to the late hour we
had kept them up eating and talking, they were too tired to
resort to argument or resistance. A numnah was placed
on the ground between the two beds for us to lie upon.
As soon as various coverings had been spread over us, we
were soon warm again and both sound asleep.
</p>

<p>
Before daybreak I was aroused by some energetic Tibetan,
gifted with a voice like a bull, bellowing forth "Chou-chou,
chou-chou, chou-chou-ou-ou-ou!" which, I am told, means,
"Up and get ready!" I think I must have dozed again
after this, for I next remembered finding myself in the open
on the ground. It was just getting light, and masses of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
laden yak were moving past us. We were both struck with
astonishment; nobody seemed to take any notice of us.
There we lay; there was no noise—everybody seemed as
though he was going to do his own work and look to nothing
else. Batch after batch quietly disappeared—merchants,
tents, yak, ponies, men, dogs, and all. All seemed to know
what was happening but ourselves; we could not grasp
the situation, but cold made us rise and try to warm
ourselves.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE KUSHOK'S TAME YAK.</p>
</div>

<p>
In spite of the wonderful disappearance of this wonderful
camp, we were glad to find that the merchant had kept his
word, for we found two very fat-looking ponies had been left
behind for us in charge of his servant Nimbri, who was
provided also with the large red bag of tsampa and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
other ingredients for mixing it up with. We weren't long
in having the kettle boiling, and Malcolm and I sat down
along with Nimbri to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Esau had gone back to hasten on the mules for fear they
should not arrive before noon. Nimbri was fully aware of
the position he held as master of the ceremonies, and for
some time was stingy with his doling out of the food; but
a present of a knife and a rupee, which at first he refused,
made him more liberal, and although all our conversation
was carried on by signs, we all laughed heartily and enjoyed
the fun. After our remarkable breakfast Nimbri gave us
two large coats, and wrapping ourselves in these, we separated
and went to sleep in some sunny nook.
</p>

<p>
I was aroused by Malcolm some time afterwards to come
and have some more breakfast, when Nimbri made signs to
us that it was about noon, and that he could wait no longer.
Just at that moment the mules came into sight round the
corner, the baggage was quickly transferred to the ponies, and
our men had soon finished the tea and tsampa, which they
so well deserved. We now looked forward to reaching the
merchants' camp before darkness and learning something
about the management of it, its size and composition.
Malcolm and I, who were in front, were soon surrounded by
a number of Tibetans, who made friendly jokes amongst
themselves and were evidently amused at our appearance.
</p>

<p>
As soon as our baggage arrived, we pitched our little tent
and attempted to return the hospitality of the merchants
by inviting them to tea, which was all we could give
them. We were anxious, too, to make a bargain with them
for hiring a yak or pony for our baggage. Just before
darkness the two merchants came, for our tent was not
more than a hundred yards off from their own. The
hospitality and comfort of our tent was but a poor apology
for that of their own, as we all four of us sat crowded up
in an uncomfortable heat. Esau was close at hand as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
interpreter, but we failed to come to any agreement about
hiring animals for the morrow. We were able, however,
to purchase some supplies, flour at eight annas,
and afterwards one rupee a pound, and ghi and salt at
correspondingly high rates.
</p>

<p>
The following morning the whole merchants' camp had
moved off before we had begun to load up. We had no
trouble in finding their tracks, and after a pleasant march
we noticed one of the mountain sides thickly dotted with
the merchants' yak out grazing, so we knew the tents would
be close at hand; everything was in full swing as if the
camp had been there for months. As we approached we
were told by Nimbri to pitch our tent near the head merchant's,
into whose tent we were soon invited to drink tea.
</p>

<p>
As we sat sipping and chatting about the country and
the people, to our great astonishment and delight he
informed us that the name of the river where we had first
seen his camp was no other than the Chu Ma, the very one
we had been in search of. Without being aware of it at
the time, we had actually discovered the source of the
Chu Ma just after leaving the beautiful fresh-water lake
abounding in wild yak. We had also followed its course
for nearly twelve days, a distance of about 120 miles. This
river is also known to the Tibetans as the Ma Chu, and to
the Mongols as the Nap-chitai-ulen. He informed us that the
intention of the Tibetans to oppose the entrance of foreigners
into Lhassa was stronger than it had ever been before; and
it was his firm belief that no one ever would reach Lhassa.
</p>

<p>
After we had made some purchases in the shape of
cheese, dates, and a piece of meat, we took our departure.
In the course of the visit we had presented the head
merchant with a small tin of saffron, which all Tibetans
value so highly. We hoped that by doing so, when he
came to visit our tent in return, he would be more inclined
to listen to a bargain for helping us with our baggage.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As soon as we were ready for the reception in our tent
of the two merchants, we sent word to them. We had
purposely got out our bottle of brandy, and hoped that, if
they would take some, they would become more liberal-minded.
They certainly warmed up and appreciated this
valuable intoxicant, although they were most cautious in
the amount they took. We produced more saffron and
talked and argued for a long while in hopes of buying a
pony at a reasonable price. At length they agreed to let
us have an old but powerful and useful pony for Rs. 60, for
which they had at first demanded Rs. 120. It was a great
relief for us to be able to do something for our three mules,
and having struck this bargain, we soon hinted to the
merchants that it was time for bed.
</p>

<p>
Before telling further of our adventures, it will be worth
while to devote a chapter in describing the merchants'
camp.

CHAPTER XVIII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
MANAGEMENT OF THE TIBETAN CARAVAN—TEA WITH THE MERCHANT—SHUGATZA
RIVER—FRICTION—AN ALARM.
</p>

<p>
The general management and internal economy of this
wonderful caravan was sufficiently full of interest to merit
a small space being devoted to its description. The head
of the caravan was a very fine-looking Tibetan from Lhassa;
he must have stood well over six feet and was exceedingly
well-built, decidedly the biggest Tibetan I have ever seen.
In the camp he was always known as the "Kushok," and
all attempts to find out his real name resulted in failure;
I very much doubt if more than one or two members of the
caravan knew it, and they dared not disclose it. The title
"Kushok" was originally applied only to living Buddhas,
but latterly it has become merely a term of respect or
affection, and no longer has any religious significance.
</p>

<p>
Next in importance to the Kushok came another big
merchant, who lived and slept in the same tent with him;
besides these two there were numerous small merchants,
some of whom owned, perhaps, as few as half a dozen yak;
and, lastly, a lama or priest. Altogether they made up an
imposing caravan of close on 1,500 yak, as near as we
could calculate. We were told that one herdsman was
employed to look after every sixty yak, but I cannot help
thinking that, in reality, there were rather more; every
man in the party, merchants, herdsmen, as well as the
cooks and servants, was mounted, so that, when on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
march, they presented a striking contrast to our sadly
reduced little party.
</p>

<p>
Their daily routine was somewhat as follows. About
4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the inferior of the two big merchants would wake up
and call to the head cook that it was time to get up, the
latter would then give a loud shout, which sounded like
"Chou-chou, chou-chou, chou-chou-ou-ou!" and which was
promptly echoed by men on guard all through the camp.
In a few moments every one was astir, tents were being
struck and yak being loaded; in an incredibly short space
of time this work was completed and the ponies were being
saddled, and in rather under an hour from the word to get
up being given the vast caravan was on the move.
</p>

<p>
The 1,500 yak were divided into seven distinct companies
and moved in column, each company superintended
by the merchants to whom the animals belonged, and kept
in order by the servants and herdsmen under them. These
seven companies were again divided into two wings, one
consisting of four, the other of the remaining three companies.
Every day they marched in the same order,
generally with a considerable distance between the two
wings, one moving off some time before the other, but
everything was managed without the slightest noise or
confusion. From the time the watchmen aroused the
sleeping camp till the moment of marching off scarcely a
voice was heard; it might then be necessary for some one
of the mounted men to scream at a refractory yak to make
him fall into his proper place; but so little, even of this,
was there that, after the first day or two, we slept peacefully
on while our Tibetan friends passed close by our tent. I
am sorry to say that we were never able to witness their
arrival in camp, but we saw enough to convince us that
everything must have been conducted in the same systematic
manner as the morning start.
</p>

<p>
On arrival in a fresh camp each company drove in its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
picketing pegs with ropes attached, so as to form a good
large rectangle; in the centre of this the baggage belonging
to the company was carefully piled. Every load was lifted
off the yak, and left ready tied up, so that it had merely to
be placed on the brute's back in the morning, for as each
load was accurately balanced no further tying was necessary.
Over the pile of baggage an awning was pitched, and the
servants made themselves snug little shelters in the middle,
where they spread their bedding. The saddles were removed
from the yak, and placed near the baggage, and then the
animals were sent out to graze, a certain proportion of the
attendants being told off to look after them. Then, and not
till then, food was prepared for the first time during the
day, for to save time in the cool of the morning, when only
yak can travel with any comfort, the start was always
made on empty stomachs; but now the cooks had got their
fires going, work was over, and the cravings of hunger could
be attended to.
</p>

<p>
We had no opportunity for seeing what arrangements
the lesser merchants made for rationing their own men,
but they were, I imagine, the same as those made by the
Kushok. His plan was as follows:—Each man was provided
with a leathern bag, which held about forty pounds of
tsamba, that is, twenty days' rations. On ration days this
was filled up for him by the cook, and he was at liberty to
eat as much or as little as he pleased. He also had butter
in proportion, but whatever he chose to do with his food no
more was issued till next ration day. The cook brewed tea
for all the employés in a huge cauldron, and when ready he
gave a peculiar cry, upon which every man came round the
fire, bringing his own tsamba, butter, and perhaps a little
cheese (chura), sugar, or other delicacy provided out of his
own pocket. Bowls were then produced from the ample
folds of the sheepskin gowns, filled up with tea by the cook,
and the meal began. When satisfied, bowls were licked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
perfectly clean and replaced in the gowns, and pipes produced.
This took place twice a day, usually about midday
and again about half-past four in the afternoon. About dusk
the yak and ponies were brought in from grazing, and this,
too, was a sight well worth seeing. I was enabled one day to
get a photograph with the kodak, but my space does not
allow me to reproduce it here. Most interesting it was to
watch how cleverly a very small number of men could control
a vast herd of semi-wild animals. All the herdsmen
were armed with long slings, with which they slung stones
or clods of earth at any stragglers, and the accuracy and
strength of the practice they made, up to about seventy
yards, was astonishing. Once in camp, a very few minutes
sufficed for saddles to be adjusted, and for every yak to
be picketed in his proper place ready for a start in the
early morning. If by any chance an animal was missing,
his absence was promptly discovered and reported to the
Kushok ; but, while we were with them, the absentees were
always brought in before nightfall.
</p>

<p>
If there was one thing more than another which aroused
our wonder in connection with this caravan, it was the extraordinary
knowledge the Kushok had of every little thing
that went on within it. Outwardly he appeared to take
scarcely any interest in anything. He rarely came outside
his tent, and seemed to spend most of his time in drinking
tea and praying. Nevertheless, nothing occurred without
his knowledge, and he certainly had managed to inspire the
lesser merchants and underlings with the greatest awe of, and
respect for, himself. No doubt he was kept carefully posted
in all camp details by his private servant, a regular little
prying busybody; but, even allowing for that, the way he
kept his subordinates in order, without appearing to know
or care what went on, was very remarkable.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that surprised us considerably was the
civility of everybody in the caravan. Few, if any, of them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
had seen a European before, but we were strangely exempt
from any offensive curiosity. Later on, in China, we often
wished that we could move about with the same freedom as
we had done in the Kushok's camp, and I am sure that
many a foreigner in England has experienced far greater
annoyance from the inquisitiveness of our fellow-countrymen
than did we among these rough Tibetans. Equally
strange was their respect for our property. While we had
been in the wilds we had got into the way of leaving a lot of
baggage outside the tent, the space inside being very limited,
and to our delight we found that we could still do so with perfect
safety; for, although the whole <i>cortège</i> passed our tent
every morning, our cartridges, ropes, saddles, tent pegs, etc.,
were every bit as safe lying outside as if they had been inside
with us. Enough has been said of this particular caravan and
of its management to show that years of experience have
resulted in an almost perfect system, but a few words about
these caravans in general may not be out of place here.
</p>

<p>
To begin with, on the Lhassa-Sining route there is no
regularly defined road, but every year the caravans renew
various old landmarks, and set up new ones on prominent
features, especially in the vicinity of the camping grounds.
It may sometimes occur that there is no one in a caravan
who has done the journey for two or three years, and if
these landmarks were not carefully kept up, great difficulty
might be experienced in finding sufficient grass and water
for the animals, on whom so much depends. As it is, they
frequently have to make long marches from one camp to
another, there being no grass between the two. The greatest
distance they did while we were with them was eighteen
miles, but they told us they often did twenty-five, and even
more, miles in a day. One caravan only leaves from each
end every year.<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> They usually start in May or the beginning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
of June, and arrive at their destination, whether it be Lhassa
or China, in October, thus getting the warmest time of year
to travel, when grass is fairly plentiful, the ice is melted,
and water easily obtainable.<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> The loads are very light, rarely
being over 120 pounds, and the marches are regulated entirely
by the supply of grass and water. They make the yak travel
a great pace, close on three and half miles an hour, so as to
get in before the sun is very hot, as they say that travelling
fast takes less out of them than travelling in the heat.
</p>

<p>
A caravan going from Lhassa into China brings the
famous pulo cloth, and great quantities of dried dates
(kasur). These come into Lhassa from Calcutta, so that by
the time they reach China they are naturally very expensive,
running, as they do, about fifteen for a rupee, in Chinese
coinage thirty cash a-piece, or a penny each in English
money. When with the caravan we bought a hundred of
these dates for two rupees, and thought we had paid a most
exorbitant price, but on arriving in China we learnt that we
had really got them very cheap.
</p>

<p>
Caravans from China into Lhassa are mostly employed
carrying tea, the main staple of food in Tibet, and a certain
amount of tobacco. The reason why only one caravan goes
each way in a year is, that all the merchants are very much
afraid of encountering robbers on the road. They therefore
prefer to wait for one another, and travel in one large body,
to running the risk of being looted <i>en route</i>. Very often
these large caravans are employed trading for the Talé
Lama, or other high officials in Lhassa, but whether this is
invariably the case, or whether it was so on this occasion, I
am unable to say. In matters of business, as well as of
geography, the Kushok and his servants were very reticent
after the first day or two.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At Tankar, the frontier town of Kansu, there are four
Tibetan officials appointed by the Talé Lama to look after
the interests of Tibetan merchants, and to arrange any
difficulties that may arise between them and the Chinese,
in addition to which duty one of the four has to accompany
the tribute to Pekin each year. They thus have plenty to
do, as there are many Tibetans on the Chinese frontier and
a big merchant, such as our acquaintance was, might stay
three years or more trading in China before returning to
Lhassa. During that time he is bound to come in contact
with numerous officials, some of whom would undoubtedly
pick quarrels with and extract undue squeezes from him, if
he had no official to whom he could appeal.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
On the 11th of September we found the merchants had
made such a long march, that it would be wise for ourselves
to make two. The day was bitterly cold, for it was the
coldest march we had experienced, and during our first halt
we felt the weather so severely that Malcolm and I walked
on ahead, leaving the men to bring on the three mules and
the pony, for the men now were quite happy and living on
the fat of the land. As soon as we had reached the
merchant's camp, we took shelter under one of the awnings,
and beckoned to Nimbri to tell him we wanted to take tea
with the merchant. Nimbri gave us to understand that if
we wanted to have tea with the merchant, we must pay one
rupee for the pleasure. Having produced this sum, we
were soon inside the Kushok's cosy tent, warming our toes
and fingers by the glowing fire as we sipped our hot tea.
Our conversation without Esau was very limited; besides,
as the two merchants were anxious to pray, we soon took
the hint and departed.
</p>

<p>
During the days spent with the merchant, we used to pay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
one of his servants to supply us daily with argols for our
fire, although, while leading a nomad's life, we had always
found an inducement and pleasure to go argol hunting. A
well-dried argol was well worth finding, and we experienced
the same delight as a mushroom gatherer in finding an
unusually large one, or a stamp collector in discovering a
rare issue.
</p>

<p>
While pursuing the caravan the next day, we noticed
some yak grazing in a nullah, and only a couple of miles
or so from the new camp, and I thought that if I could
shoot one of these, we might induce the merchants to carry
the trophy for us into China. These yak were so placed
that I had no alternative left me but to walk openly up the
valley they were grazing in. They took no notice of me
till within 150 yards, when they began to move off, but
a single shot from my carbine knocked over the largest one
stone dead. I was somewhat surprised, for I considered my
shot had been directed too far back. On cutting up the
brute, I found I had destroyed his liver, which had been
the cause of his death.
</p>

<p>
On arrival into camp, I found one of the Kushok's
ponies, on which he placed a high price, was dying. In
order to save the animal's life, he had bought a spoonful
of brandy from Malcolm, for a pound of flour. In this
transaction the merchant was certainly the loser.
</p>

<p>
We learnt that the Kushok intended to remain halted the
next day. This was welcome news to us, for our three mules
had not had an entire day's rest for over two months, and
all our writing and mapping was behindhand. We wanted,
too, to purchase more supplies, which operation with these
people always took up a great deal of time. Above all
things, we thought we should be able to take a number of
pictures with our kodak, illustrative of typical scenes in
the camp.
</p>

<p>
The day of rest was a glorious one of peace and sunshine.<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
The smoke from the different fires curled straight
up towards the heavens, and all seemed to be enjoying the
quiet change. On the opposite side of the valley we could
see all the hundreds of yak, resembling at that distance a
large ants' nest. The morning was spent entirely in buying
supplies. The prices had been raised, so that we tried to
buy from some of the minor merchants. But the ever
inquisitive Nimbri, on discovering this, informed his master,
who, being all, powerful in the camp, forbade the selling of
any supplies to us except by himself. He made himself
unpleasant with regard to other small matters. We could
see it was the Kushok's intention to bleed us, and we were
so placed that we could not help ourselves, yet, during
the morning, he sent us a special blend of tea. It was
certainly first-rate, both a thick and sustaining drink.
During the afternoon we managed to take some snap-shots
before the members of the camp could grasp what our little
game was, or, more correctly speaking, grew suspicious of
our intentions.
</p>

<p>
We were all reinvigorated by the one day's halt, and at
daybreak continued our descent, all the way down a magnificent
gorge, the mountains on either side being very lofty
and precipitous. Eventually the gorge became very narrow,
before reaching a well-marked camping ground of short,
green grass. We had come to a district abounding in scrub
and thorn bush two or three feet high. Some of the sticks
of these bushes were an inch in diameter, while the air was
scented with the fragrant smell of herbs. To see vegetation,
even of this barren description, was a pleasant sensation to
us, for we had seen no kind of vegetation bigger than a
wild onion, since leaving Niagzu, some four months ago.
</p>

<p>
After our breakfast we proceeded on our march, following
the dry bed of a stream, which brought us to a river which
we learnt was the Shugatza, or Shuga Gol. This, strange
to say, was flowing in a nearly opposite direction to that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
in which we ourselves were going, and was soon lost to
view, hidden by the hills in its north-west course. On the
right bank of the river, to which we had to cross, was the
Kushok's camp, with the yak wandering about in the plain,
which was covered with splendid grass. On the left bank
was a range of hills called the Tong Hills.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-231" id="i-231"></a>
<img src="images/i-231.jpg" width="453" height="543" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SOME MEMBERS OF THE KUSHOK'S CAMP.</p>
</div>

<p>
We made several attempts at crossing the water, which,
although deep and some thirty yards across, presented the
advantage of a firm, stony bottom. We thought the Kushok
might have pointed out the place to cross by. This, we at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
length found, was only three feet deep. That night we
had no transactions at all with the merchants, although,
curiously enough, they came to our servants' apology for a
tent and hobnobbed with them.
</p>

<p>
Our route onwards, which was up-stream of the Shugatza,
took us over fine prairie land, teeming with immense herds
of kyang, who, under the leadership of some chosen stallion,
manœuvred round and about us, often within shooting
distance. They seemed in no way to feel this exceptionally
warm day. We were at a very little higher altitude than
Leh itself, and were not sorry to find the merchants
had only marched nine miles, half the distance of the
previous day.
</p>

<p>
We discovered the camp pitched just at the foot of a
range of hills, which protected them from any welcome
breeze that might have sprung up. A small stream trickled
from these hills, and formed a pond below. So still was the
atmosphere that the smoke from the several fires was
diffused neither to the right nor to the left, but curled very
slowly upwards. The ponies and yak were either standing
knee-deep in the water or lying about in the grass with
no inclination for grazing, while the men who were not
attending to the fires were either asleep in the tents or
stretched out in the open. It was a scene of absolute quiet
and perfect peace.
</p>

<p>
We soon pitched our little camp, and took our latitude
from the midday sun. As there was no wind we had some
trouble in making our fire burn, so sent a message to the
Kushok to ask him kindly to lend us some bellows. We
also inquired if he would allow us to photograph himself
and his own tent, which was always conspicuous in the
camp by reason of the flag that flapped from the end of
the pole. To neither of these requests would he assent.
We had half expected that this would be the case, for the
merchants somehow or other wore an air of indifference to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
us now, and had given up the friendly turn they first showed
towards us. It might have been the natural behaviour of
these men, and perhaps we were wrong in our surmises,
but we felt as though a screw was loose somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the day he sent his servant Nimbri to borrow
our frying-pan, small as it was. We at once saw an opening
of showing the merchants that we were not going to be
entirely dependent on them, so sent him back word that
unless he would lend us his bellows each day, we would
not lend him our frying-pan. This had the desired effect,
for the merchant came to see us, and the bargain was
struck. Although at the time we considered this of
much importance, it showed how childish both parties
had grown.
</p>

<p>
Since the time when we had first become acquainted with
these merchants, and learnt that they were going to Barong
in the Tsaidam before reaching Tankar on the Chinese
border, we saw the advantage of travelling in their company,
for we were all bound for the same destination. Yet we
could never get any definite or reliable answer as to how
far off Barong was, either from the merchants or from any
of the underlings. In fact, whenever we broached the
question, we were always given to understand that Barong
was further off than ever. They would neither tell us
anything about the road or how to find our way there,
excepting that they repeated the intricacies of the route
and the impossibility of finding it by ourselves.
</p>

<p>
We knew quite well they were desirous that we should
travel with them for two reasons; firstly, that they might
bleed us of all our rupees, and secondly, that they might
rely upon our protection against predatory tribes, such as
the Golok, in the neighbourhood of whose country we
should have to march. The Kushok was very fond of our
rifles, and admired them, yet when we offered him one
during our bargains, he explained that it was of no use to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
him unless we gave him two or three hundred rounds of
ammunition as well, which of course we could not do.
</p>

<p>
On this day, the 15th of September, the Kushok declared
that Barong was a journey of twenty days distant, but we
calculated from our own observations that it would only
take us about a week to get there if we could but find the
way. We knew we were unable to buy food for us all for
twenty more days at his starvation prices, and decided to
buy from him four or five days' rations and then leave the
merchants by shoving on ahead and making longer marches.
Of course, our great difficulty was to know the right way to
go, for very often there was absolutely no clue for miles;
and if we once wandered off wrongly, it would mean much
useless meandering over mountains, during which we should
probably be lost altogether. We tried our utmost to gain
information about the road from the servants. One man
told one thing and the next something else directly contrary
to what the former had said. A great many of them
very likely really did not know, and those who did had
been forbidden by the Kushok to tell us. An order from
the Kushok was not one to be trifled with, for in this
caravan he was omnipotent.
</p>

<p>
One circumstance that exercised the Kushok's mind was
the plane-table surveying of Shahzad Mir. To ward off
suspicion, we purposely marched in the wake of the merchants;
but Shahzad Mir would always arrive in camp a
few minutes after ourselves, carrying the plane-table, and
this always puzzled the Kushok. "Why," he asked, "was
Shahzad Mir always made to come in last carrying this
square board? What offence had he committed to merit
such a punishment as this?" He was alluding to the
Chinese penalty for crime of carrying the wooden collar,
which is commonly known to us as the "cangue."
</p>

<p>
As we had reached a fine grass country, the merchants
were going to make the most of it by allowing their yak
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
plenty of time to graze. On the 16th of September they only
marched three miles, and furthermore gave us to understand
that they would remain at rest at this encampment
the following day. They had certainly chosen a very beautiful
spot. The camp was pitched on the richest of pasture land,
with hills on either side of it. There was also a spring of
cold, clear water, supplying enough for all. The stream
formed by this spring separated the Tibetans from ourselves.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we learnt that it was the intention of the
merchants to remain so long in this place, we grew impatient
at what we considered to be a quite unnecessary
delay on their part. So annoyed were we, that we went to
the Kushok's tent and demanded four or five days' supply of
flour and butter, which, up to date, we had only been buying
in quantity sufficient for the day. To our astonishment
he flatly refused to sell us this amount; he would only sell
us just enough for present use. We at once saw the game
he was playing. As long as he denied us more food than
we daily required, he felt sure we dare not have faced the
inhospitable and uninhabited solitude of the mountains
again without means of sustenance at hand. We retired
after this piece of incivility to our side of the spring to
debate together upon what course to pursue. We made up
our minds that, rather than be in the power or under the yoke
of these Tibetans, we would risk all and launch forth again into
the vast unknown, and thereupon gave orders to our men to
prepare for loading up and marching again that very day.
</p>

<p>
At this crisis, we became aware that in an instant the
camp of the Tibetans, from a scene of peace and repose,
had become one of excitement, turmoil, and confusion.
What on earth had happened? Some men were scaling the
hills; even the Kushok himself had made this the scene of
his contribution to the general hubbub, while others were
running about and fixing their rests in the ground for firing,
and were loading and priming their matchlocks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XIX.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
WE LEAVE THE KUSHOK—A USELESS CLIMB—SIGNS OF A
DISASTROUS JOURNEY—A HOUSE OF PRAYER—MALCOLM
SHOOTS A BEAR—ANXIETY FOR FOOD.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the Kushok had reached the summit of the hill
above our own camp, we saw that he was pointing with his
hand at something or other which was causing this uproar,
for men were now firing off their matchlocks at some distant
rocks. Just then Nimbri came to us to borrow our glasses
for the Kushok. He came with such an air of superiority
that we declined to lend them, which enraged the Kushok
in no slight degree.
</p>

<p>
Being bitten with curiosity to find out what they were all
gazing and pointing at, we climbed the hill ourselves, and
saw, a long way down the valley, on the other bank of the
Shugatza, smoke ascending to the skies, and apparently
coming from some camp or other, for close to the place
where the smoke rose were a number of animals dotted
about, but whether they were yak, mules, or ponies, even
with our glasses we could not clearly make out. One
thing we all felt certain of was that there was another large
encampment, even larger than the Tibetan one, on the
banks of the Shuga Gol. Whether it was that belonging to
another body of merchants, or, what was considered more
likely, a large camp of the Golok tribe, it was impossible to
decide at that distance.
</p>

<p>
Without more ado we made up our minds as to what line
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
of action to take. We gave orders to our men to load up
the three mules and the pony, and, going up to the Kushok,
told him we were off to join the new encampment, telling
him that if these strangers proved to be another body of
merchants, we would, without a doubt, be able to get supplies
from them, and that if, on the other hand, they
proved to be some of the Golok, why, we had no fear of
them, for we were well armed.
</p>

<p>
Such a turning of the tables brought the Kushok to his
proper standard, and made him recognize the fact that
Englishmen have more ways of shifting than one. He
begged us to remain with his caravan and give him our
assistance, but finding that our decision was not to be
revoked, for the mules, too, were by this time being loaded,
he made up his mind still to benefit as much as he could
by selling us the flour, etc.; and we, on our side, deeming
that four or five days' certain supply was preferable to
risking the chance of finding other merchants who would
sell, decided to purchase this amount from him. Having
settled it, we lost no time in completing the loading and
leaving in triumph the Kushok's camp, receiving a hostile
salute from the fierce dogs at our departure.
</p>

<p>
Although we had misgivings about finding our way to
Barong, in the Tsaidam, and blamed the merchants for
their secretiveness in this respect, still, we parted with
feelings of friendship, for we could not forget the great
hospitality and help they had given us in our distress, in
spite of our anything but winning appearance, and, after
all is said and done, the hankering after the rupees is
the natural bent not only of Tibetan merchants, but of
almost all other merchants of every civilized or uncivilized
country.
</p>

<p>
Thus, on the afternoon of the 16th September, we once
more launched forth into the wilds, an independent little
party. We marched till long after dark that evening, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
could see no light to show us where this strange encampment
was located.
</p>

<p>
The first thing the next morning I ascended a hill, and,
remarkable to relate, became convinced that the baggage
animals we had seen from the Kushok's camp grazing,
were nothing else than immense numbers of wild yak and
wild kyang, and, as to the smoke, we accounted for this by
the natural phenomenon of mist arising from the river, for
we could see no signs of any encampment at all. During
the morning we had but little difficulty in finding our way,
for the route was marked by previous encampments and
old chulas. We unloaded for breakfast by a fresh spring
at the foot of some red hills, the home of the chough, whilst
many hares dwelt in the stones and grass below.
</p>

<p>
Soon after starting again we noticed a nullah turning up
northwards to our left, marked in a very conspicuous way
by a natural wall of earth at the mouth, on which had been
placed, as well as on the neighbouring hills, several heaps
of stones piled one on the other three or four feet high.
We knew by our map we should have to leave the Shuga
Gol and cross a range of mountains called the Burhan Bota
before reaching the Tsaidam, and we thought that this
must be the spot, and that it had been thus significantly
ornamented, that no one travelling this route could go past
without noticing the way.
</p>

<p>
We found on nearer approach there were two roads into
the nullah, one by a narrow pathway over the wall, and the
other, a broader one, by a small stream on the right side of
the wall. As we followed the stream a few hundred yards
up the mouth of the nullah we came to the source of this
water. It was busily bubbling forth from the top of a rock
between four and five feet high that stood midway in our
path. The rock was stained a black and yellow colour, and
the water itself was quite hot, but was tasteless.
</p>

<p>
Just inside the wall at the entrance, other lower and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
smaller walls had been built, apparently to afford protection
from the winds. Against these were several chulas, and
lying everywhere were quantities of bones of animals. The
hot spring was doubtless the cause of all these landmarks,
which had not been stuck up as a signboard to show the
road to the Tsaidam, as we had taken it to mean, and in
consequence of our mistake, we had a long, useless climb
right up the nullah, over stony mountains, and down another
nullah back to our valley again, on the banks of the Shugatza,
having made but little progress, and tired our transport to
no purpose.
</p>

<p>
Our men were complaining that they must have a meal of
tea and tsampa before starting the morning's march, as they
could not walk for five hours without. It appeared that
one of them had a watch, and told them they had been
marching five hours, whereas they had not been going for
three. When I explained to them that they had only
marched for this length of time, they were quite themselves
again, and the sour looks which had disfigured their faces
were soon changed to one of laughter.
</p>

<p>
We found numbers of yak and kyang along the banks of
the river, but they were too knowing to allow of our shooting
them. By reason of this, we had been doubting whether
the track we were following was that of wild animals or
otherwise, until our minds were relieved by Lassoo finding
some camel droppings. These assuring signs, added to the
discovery of more chulas, and marks of previous encampments,
cast all doubts aside, and at length brought us
to the mouth of a broad, stony nullah, which ran in the
direction of some white, rocky hills, which looked perfectly
impenetrable.
</p>

<p>
We began to regret not having exchanged with the
merchants all our remaining rupees for more tsampa. It
was always a pleasure to see our faithful followers enjoy
this simple feast. They would eat their fill in silence, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
rather partial fill, their eyes disclosing their thoughts, which
wandered far back to their homes in Ladakh, where tea
and tsampa is their staple food.
</p>

<p>
We had now left the banks of the Shuga Gol, and were
about to enter the narrow opening of a nullah, which we
rightly conjectured would take us over the Shuga range of
mountains. At this spot were many camel droppings and
other signs, which made it manifest that those who attempted
to cross these mountains camped here just before or just
after the toilsome journey.
</p>

<p>
It was a rugged, rough, cold-looking pass, and, at the
various bends, the wind blew with violent, cruel blasts.
For nearly four hours we continued to mount up this stony
gorge, till a small patch of grass and the pangs of hunger
demanded a halt. This was accompanied with much cold
and damp, for during most of the morning snow and sleet
had been falling. As we continued the ascent, our anxiety
increased as to the chances of having to spend the night
in so high and cheerless a place. Our fears were doubled
by our finding every mile three or four skeletons of dead
yak—tame ones, easily recognized by the small size and
thinness of their horns. The caravan that had last marched
by this route must have made a terrible and disastrous
journey. Amongst other signs of their misfortunes we
picked up a keg of opium.
</p>

<p>
At length joy crowned our fears, for we reached a large
pile of stones, denoting that the summit of the pass was
here. We continued from this point to descend steadily,
till after sunset, and pitched our little tent in an old
encamping ground. We knew that such was the case,
for, close at hand, stood out alone a small hill, on which
were three piles of stones the size of men. It is probable
that there is a spring somewhere near this hill, but none
of us had inclination to go in search, when we could satisfy
our wants with the snow that lay around.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After a bitterly cold night we descended gaily over grassy
plains, for the morning was bright and the sun had polished
up the snow peaks that surrounded us on all sides, so that
they shone again. Kyang, antelope, and sand-grouse had
selected these pastures, and afforded us sport and provender
as we marched. The pleasure of the day was somewhat
marred by our inability to find any water before nightfall.
At that hour we came to a very noticeable hill, standing at
the entrance of a nullah. On the top of this hill was a large
heap of stones decorated with many sticks and red rags.
We were all glad to see it, for we had learnt by now that
this signified a camping ground. There lay a few skeletons
of tame yak. A spring of beautifully clear water took its
rise here, while lovely grass grew everywhere.
</p>

<p>
We afterwards learnt that this remarkable spot is named
Dapsoga, and the hill Ser, and that from here there are two
roads which lead over the Burhan Bota range of mountains
into the Tsaidam. One of these roads, called the Burhan
Bota Pass, takes a more westerly course, and is longer than
the other, which is called the Namoran Dawan (Pass). This
latter road, though shorter, is more difficult by reason of
the thick brushwood and the river, which has frequently
to be crossed. Merchants who go this way complain that
they invariably lose some of their baggage animals in the
undergrowth. Of course, at the time of our arrival, we knew
nothing about any road at all, and quite unconsciously
elected to take the Namoran Dawan.
</p>

<p>
We followed the stream whose source we had found,
which flowed rapidly over a stony bottom, so that, although
the water was only knee deep, it was difficult for us to keep
our footing. The precipitous mountains, that sometimes
ran clean down to the water's edge, compelled us, on each
occasion, to cross the torrent. These hills were rugged and
bare. At other times the nullah became broad, with a wider
bed to the river. At such places there grew grass and thick
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
brushwood, some of it eight feet high. At one of these
delightful spots we made our midday halt, as other caravans
had done, judging from the many chulas we found. Further
on we found many traces along the path of people, sheep
and ponies having journeyed this way.
</p>

<p>
We found our commissariat was at its lowest ebb, for
although we had seen a hare and three snipe, we had shot
nothing, and we reflected that unless we killed something
the next day we should have to live on air and water. As
we looked down stream it seemed as though it would soon
issue out into open plains, where we anticipated finding
people.
</p>

<p>
It was hard to make a start the next morning, for Esau
and Lassoo had got silly fancies into their heads that the
water was too cold to cross, and until we explained to them
the impossibility of this fact we remained at a standstill.
The truth of their statement, nevertheless, we inwardly
agreed to, and afterwards outwardly felt the force of it.
Without any sun, and a strong north-east wind blowing, our
constant plunging into the torrent, ever increasing in force
and volume, deprived our legs of all feeling. Fortunately
a solitary kyang fell to Malcolm's rifle, and at noon we
saw, on the other side of the river, thick brushwood,
unmistakably an old camping ground. Once more we
stumbled over the stony bottom of the river, and then,
collecting a pile of the thickest brushwood, we made a huge
fire to dry our clothes by and to cook our wild donkey for
breakfast.
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded after this rest and repast, we came to
more jungle, composed principally of wild raspberry and
currant bushes, and other red berries, to all of which we
did ample justice; even the little dog, Ruby, picked the
berries from the bushes with her mouth, for she must
have felt the want of other nourishment as much as we
ourselves did.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Around and about the bushes were more marks of sheep
having recently been grazing there. All were jubilant, for
even if we did not find people that evening, we had a
small supply of meat. Our men at last lost all control as,
with shouts of joy, they tore along through the fruit bushes
towards a stone building which had appeared in sight.
</p>

<p>
All thought our goal at last was reached. On drawing
closer to this, we found it consisted of a small stone building,
about twelve feet square and of the same height. Looking
through the rails of the small wooden door, we found the
whole space occupied by a large prayer-wheel, which for
ever was being turned round by the force of the stream.
Over the door, in a ledge, was a packet of prayers, which
I appropriated. The prayers were written on paper and
wrapped up in cloth. On looking around for more curiosities,
I found prayers and rags were hanging from several of the
bushes and trees; on one particular fruit tree was the
longest prayer of all, written on white cloth and tied by
ropes to it. The temptation to take this religious offering
was too great for me, for I untied the knots, and pulling down
the cloth with a feeling of sacrilege, overpowered by that of
curiosity, I hastily rolled the thing up and hid it away,
glancing round in case there might be some one looking on
unobserved but close at hand. It would have been a bad
beginning to strike up a friendship with strangers by being
caught in the act of outraging their religion. We were not,
however, destined to meet people just at present. Shortly
after our excitement had worn off, we saw slowly moving
along with measured pace, on the opposite bank of the river,
a fine black bear. This was his last evening walk, for
Malcolm soon bowled him over with a well-directed bullet
through the head. This episode, and the misty rain that
now enshrouded us, demanded a halt.
</p>

<p>
We had to bring the bear's skin and fat over the river,
after cutting him up on the other side, yet this unpleasant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
work and the wet weather made no impression on the good
spirits of the men. Our Duffadar was perhaps the most
jubilant, for he fully expected the next day to swagger
through a Mongol village with all the war-paint he could
muster under the trying times.
</p>

<p>
As we marched down the gorge we found strings of
prayers hung from tree to tree, written on pieces of red,
blue, and white-coloured cloth. But after about three
miles' tramp through the fruit bushes, we crossed over a
highish ridge and then debouched into an arid, stony plain,
and our river wended away to the south. This was a very
bitter disappointment to all, for just at the moment when
we had expected to view the homely comfort of a nomad's
camp, or of a Mongol village, we could see nothing but a
stretch of desert country to relieve the eye.
</p>

<p>
We reproached ourselves for having been so thoughtless
about our supply of meat, for we had only with us a
small portion of the last donkey slain, and some of the
bear's grease. Our three mules, though thin, were fairly
strong, and we determined not to dally and bemoan our
fate, but rather to hasten on all the quicker and try and cross
this desolate country. After about twelve miles we hit off
our stream again, and found a spot to halt by a little
undergrowth. Everywhere else was bare and arid; even
the hills, which gradually died away into the plains we were
crossing, were entirely devoid of vegetation. At our little
camp we could see signs of former encampments, and there
was a pile of stones on the other side of the river, inviting
us to cross, with as much as to say, "This is the way,
gentlemen."

<h2>
CHAPTER XX.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
FOLLOWING THE NAMORAN—WE SPLIT INTO THREE PARTIES—WE
MEET SOME YOUNG MONGOLS—THEIR HOSPITALITY—LOBSAN—THE
BANA TRIBES.
</p>

<p>
Since leaving the merchants, Barong in the Tsaidam had
been our goal, but the very incomplete maps, and the small
scale upon which they were drawn, gave us but scanty
assistance.
</p>

<p>
At noon I took the latitude, and learnt that, according
to Rockhill's map, we had already arrived just north of
Barong, which lay to our east, and, according to our other
map, we were just south of the town. Our inclination was,
therefore, to accept the invitation of the pile of stones, and
follow the narrow track over the sand; but our men were
so averse to crossing the water again, that we reluctantly
gave way to them. In order to cross this tract of wearisome
country, and to save the mules from the sun's rays, we
did not move on again till late in the afternoon, with the
intention of continuing the march by moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Our plans, however, were destroyed by reason of the dark,
misty evening that spread over us, so that we deemed it
wiser to halt for the night. We could hear the rushing
of the Namoran Gol on our right hand, so were able to get
plenty of water.
</p>

<p>
From here we marched almost due north, still following
the Namoran, which became split up into many small
rivulets. The way was sandy, with loose stones, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
small bushes which we had reached were half covered on
one side by the sand, which had been heaped up by the force
of the wind. The morning was very hot, and a sore trial
for our three veterans, who could only travel at a slow
pace. Yet how could we halt in such a wilderness? At
length we reached sandy hillocks, covered with a kind of
waving furze bush, such as grows by the seaside, and
growing in between was long, coarse, green grass, while the
river became more than ever split up into little streams,
most of which one could jump across. Most acceptable of
all were the tracks we found of ponies and camels. Yet,
tracks or no tracks, it was impossible for our three mules
to proceed any further, and choosing the most shade-giving
bush, sheltered from the wind by a large, sandy hillock,
we called a halt, and let our mules loose to revel in the
running water and the coarse grass.
</p>

<p>
We climbed up the highest mound in the neighbourhood,
to reconnoitre the stretch of country below us.
We could see a vast plain, covered to a great extent with
bush, extending to a far-distant range of hills. And we
fancied we could make out a river flowing at right angles
to our own route, and reckoned quite rightly that this
must be the Bayan Gol. Nevertheless, we could see no
signs of people or villages. The sun by its brightness
made the actual distinguishing of objects an uncertain
undertaking. We were perplexed as to our further progress,
for to have marched on aimlessly with our three
mules, to their probable death, would have been a foolish
decision.
</p>

<p>
We finally agreed to carry out the following plans. While
Shahzad Mir and Shukr Ali remained encamped with the
mules, Malcolm would take Lassoo, and I Esau, and set
out in different directions with the intention of not returning
till we had found people. Futhermore, in order that we
might find the camp, the two men left behind were going
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
to make huge bonfires every hour after dark. In bush
country with no definite landmark, even those most skilled
in the arts of a wanderer have a difficult job in returning
to a spot they have once left.
</p>

<p>
Having divided the remnants of the donkey flesh amongst
the three parties, we set out on our different errands.
While Malcolm was to travel north, I took a line a little
more easterly. Esau and I kept our eyes and ears
open for any signs of mankind, and at first we saw camel
and pony droppings, as we had seen previously that day,
and afterwards chulas; then places where the streams had
been dammed to divert their course. Then we saw several
tracks running north by east. But I was not anxious to go
further north, for I felt convinced we were leaving Barong
on our right, and behind us.
</p>

<p>
Whilst Esau and I paused in our deliberations our doubts
were removed by hearing the distant bark of a dog. We
hastened on without more ado in the direction of the noise,
now and again drawing up and listening in silence for a
repetition of the barking to guide us. Each time we heard
it more distinctly, and all the while the tracks we were
following became more defined and more numerous. We
were actually following the footsteps of a man! Then we
both suddenly stopped, for we could hear the cheerful voice
of a boy or girl singing. We both ran through the bush to
learn who this was.
</p>

<p>
We could hardly credit the picture we caught a glimpse
of through the thick bush. There was a fine flock of fat
sheep being driven homewards, for it was now evening, by
some young boys and girls riding barebacked their well-fed
ponies. They were singing all the while from mere light-heartedness,
ignorant of all trouble and the outside world,
and that two strangers were hidden but a few yards behind.
I watched in secret this scene of perfect worldly peace and
happiness, before disturbing the partakers of it by a loud
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
incongruous exclamation, "Hullo!" They turned round at
once to meet this unheard-of sound, and though they
received us without fear, their astonishment might well be
pardoned. We walked along with them, unable to understand
each other, till we found ourselves surrounded by
several men, one or two amongst whom were able to understand
Esau's Tibetan talk.
</p>

<p>
They were all nice-looking fellows, with pleasant, smiling
faces, of stout build, with strong arms and deep chests. As
for the women they were quite becoming, with their bronzed
faces illuminated by a reddish tint on each cheek. The
youngsters all looked the picture of plump health and happiness.
Amongst the people in this district I never saw any
kind of illness or disfigurement. After the preliminary
salutations of "Where are you going?" "Where do you
come from?" "Who are you?" etc., we made a small wood
fire on the ground, and squatting round it began to talk
over matters, and perhaps the thought uppermost in our
minds was to convince them of the fact that we were really
very hungry.
</p>

<p>
It was quite evident that the people amongst whom we
had fallen were of a hospitable and kindly disposition. They
were the Tsokpo or Sokpor Mongols. It was finally arranged
that Esau should return with two of them, all mounted, to
our camp, and bring on the caravan to this place, while
I was to stop with them and await its arrival. A bright
moon had just risen, which made it an easy night for
travelling.

<p class="caption">TSOKPO MONGOLS LIVING IN THE BUSH.</p>
</div>

<p>
As soon as Esau had departed they beckoned to me to
follow them. We went at a fast walk, as we twisted in and
out between the bushes, all looking strange by moonlight.
After half an hour, they suddenly turned to their right, and
there I saw a clear, circular piece of ground, surrounded and
concealed by bushes. In the centre was a hole in the ground,
with a fire burning inside it, and around were arranged some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
huge cooking-pots, which were boiling something or other.
Around this were squatting men and women, evidently
waiting for their supper to be cooked. On one side were a
number of sacks piled up, which I guessed contained grain.
I was terribly hungry, and could scarcely keep my eyes from
the cooking-pots, which just fitted the holes made in the
ground, by means of which the contents were being boiled.
I was made to sit down by the fire against the sacks, when
my host, who had guided me here, and appeared to be chief
of the party, opened one of the pots, and forthwith pulled
out a well-boiled shoulder of mutton, which I took from
his hands and was soon gnawing at; on its completion my
host presented me with a leg and afterwards with a neck.
Then I began to reflect within myself what a reputation for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
an Englishman's greed I was bringing amongst these people,
so I stoutly refused his pressing invitations to accept more,
and contented myself with several doses of hot soup and tea,
to which was added butter and tsampa.
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of this much appreciated repast, during
which each member of the party selected from any of the
pots whichever bit of mutton he fancied, alternating his or her
diet with the tea and tsampa or soup, they began to examine
my clothes and belongings. Everything created the greatest
curiosity; the use of my compass, which I tried to explain,
was full of interest to them, but the greatest astonishment
was shown at the ticking of my watch, which passed round
the hands of the entire circle.
</p>

<p>
After we had finished our smoking and the examination
was exhausted, men and women dispersed to their own
particular corners for sleep, while I, lying down between
two of them, was covered up with warm sheepskins, and
soon fell asleep too. I was aroused long before daylight to
find that our little caravan had arrived, and shortly afterwards,
about 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, Malcolm himself appeared, accompanied
by a number of friendly Mongols—for he, too, had come
across them, and had met with equal hospitality. We soon
had a big fire burning, and the kettle boiling; and whilst
our men sat chatting with the Mongols, in the thorough
enjoyment of their tea, tsampa, and butter, and of meeting
strangers once again, Malcolm and I wrapped ourselves up
in our blankets to sleep till sunrise.
</p>

<p>
On awaking from a refreshing rest we found our men
still busily engaged in mixing up the tea and tsampa, whilst
around and about lay Mongols sleeping soundly; everywhere,
too, there lay scattered all our belongings, an easy
prey to anybody who might feel inclined to take them.
From the moment we fell in with these trustful, hospitable
nomads, we instinctively felt that our guns, our ammunition,
in fact, all we possessed, were just as safe amongst them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
from robbery as we had found them to be when travelling
with the Tibetan merchants. As for our three noble mules,
they were now enjoying what must have been to them a
paradise. Everywhere grew rich grass and fruit bushes,
intersected by small streams, and there they wandered
knee-deep, grazing to their heart's content, doubtless
entirely forgetful of all the trying times they had carried
us through. It was no small pleasure to ourselves either,
to see them thus provided for, and we agreed never to place
another load on their backs as long as they remained in
our care, but to hire, by hook or crook, ponies from the
Mongols, whilst they should march the last 300 miles to
the Chinese border with ease and comfort.
</p>

<p>
As soon as all were awake, and whilst a breakfast of
more mutton and tea was being discussed, it was arranged
that we should move on a few miles, to a spot where we
could better bargain for supplies of food and for ponies
to take us to the Chinese border.
</p>

<p>
The chief of the Mongols amongst whom we were
living was a man called Lobsan, and it was close to his
home in the bush that we had taken our things. It
was soon common news throughout the few miles of bush
wherein these nomads were residing that two strangers
had arrived who were anxious to purchase food. Lobsan
was a man well known throughout the district, and being a
man of superior energy and intellect, he carried no small
weight amongst his neighbours; besides, he had travelled
more than the majority of them—he had made the journey
three times to China, and in addition to that he had
resided some months in the capital, Lhassa, and had become
initiated in the studies of the Buddhist religion; he was,
in consequence, acquainted with the different routes to
Lhassa. He explained to us how we had traversed the
Namoran route instead of the Burhan Bota, which was the
longer of the two; he pointed out, too, the exact position of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
the town of Barong Tsaidam, agreeing admirably with our
own calculations; above all, he strengthened and confirmed
our information with regard to our discovery of the source
of the Chu Ma river, an upper tributary of the Yang-tse.
</p>

<p>
We made our encampment under the shade of a large
fruit tree, where Lobsan's stout ponies had brought our
goods, and as we sat there with Lobsan by our side, men
and women flocked in from all quarters to try their fortune
in this novel market. It was soon current that our ready
rupees were the exchange; rupees they preferred to most
other things we could suggest, such as knives, watches or
saffron. The only article they really asked for in return
was "sin," or needles, of which we hadn't a single one.
Some of them brought tsampa, or tulshi (flour), or mar
(butter), or chura (cheese), each bringing from a few
pounds down to half a pound of any article, and, as we
had to lay in at least a fortnight's supply, a great deal of
bargaining had to be negotiated. All this was managed
through Lobsan, who probably received some slight remuneration
from each of the successful bargains. As a rule, we
paid a rupee for four pounds of tsampa, or flour, and the
same price for a pound of butter, while two sheep cost us
three and a half and four and a half rupees respectively.
</p>

<p class="caption">MALCOLM ENGAGES ATTENTION OF MONGOLS WITH "CADBURY": THEY THINK IT IS SNUFF.</p>
</div>

<p>
As each Mongol turned up he would say what the price
of his bag of flour or skin of butter was, and of course
more than what was right. Many others would be standing
around, watching with interest the new scene that presented
itself, and see us demur with surprise at the high
price that was asked; yet, although the price was never
mentioned, all knew well what it was. The bargaining was
carried out under cover of the sleeve of their sheepskin
cloaks. Lobsan, after interviewing the vendor in this
manner, would take hold of my hand, concealed inside
his own sleeve, and seize four of my fingers, signifying
that four rupees was the price of the goods; whereupon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
looking him in the face, I would seize three of his fingers,
or three and a half to represent three and a half rupees,
as the case might be, as my price, and this information
would at once be transmitted to all onlookers in the same
fashion. Although every bargain was carried out in secrecy,
without speaking a word, still all knew just as well what
was taking place as if the tongue, instead of hidden fingers,
had been the medium adopted.
</p>

<p>
Our attempts at purchasing some of their ponies were
unsuccessful, for with our finances in such a crippled state,
we could not, had we been willing, have paid the price they
demanded, namely, 50 to 120 rupees for an altogether worn-out
and aged baggage pony.
</p>

<p>
It took very little to amuse thoroughly these good-natured,
unsophisticated nomads; even our sponge, which
we at length had leisure and opportunity to make use of,
attracted their curiosity. Still even more astonishing to
them was a half-filled tin of Cadbury's cocoa, which they
would insist could be nothing else than snuff. As Malcolm
thus engaged their attention, I took a snap-shot of the
little group with my kodak. As soon as they discovered
this in my hands all was wonderment again, yet so trustful
and unsuspicious were these people that they were not at
all averse to being photographed, with the exception of
one lady mounted on horseback; yet even she unwittingly
fell a victim, as may be seen on the following page.
</p>

<p>
At our revolvers, when we fired off six shots without
reloading, they were thoroughly filled with bewilderment,
and standing up a slab of caked mud some twenty paces
off as a target, they signed for me to try my skill upon it.
Six successful holes redoubled their astonishment, and
proved to them how easy it was for us to travel through
districts which were considered dangerous, although we
were so few. One of the more influential Mongols, seizing
my unloaded revolver in an agitated and warlike fashion,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
snapped off the trigger six times in different directions,
each time shouting out the word "Bana!" while all around
laughed and acquiesced in the meaning of this man's frantic
gestures.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that in order to reach China we should have
to pass through a district inhabited by the Bana tribes, who
are noted for their predatory habits.
</p>

<p>
They are represented on the map by the name "Bana-khasum,"
"sum," meaning three—that is to say, there
are three of these Bana tribes, who live round and about
the regions of the Koko Nor Lake. These three tribes
are again subdivided into eighteen small tribes, each with a
separate chief, the whole being under the Sining Amban or
Tsongt'u. It is on account of these and other tribes that
merchants are afraid to traverse the country singly, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
reason why these Tsokpo Mongols so seldom make the
journey to the Chinese frontier. It was fear of these Bana
tribes that caused us so much delay before we could induce
them to fit us out with sufficient ponies and accompany us
over our last few hundred miles. The Bana men have been
known to come even as far as Barong itself on a raid, and
being better armed and more numerous than the Tsokpo
Mongols, these latter live in no slight dread of going near
their warlike neighbours.

WITH THE MONGOLS—A HOSPITABLE OLD LADY—ON THE WAY TO

PLACE—KANJUR RUNGYUM.
</p>

<p>
It was arranged that on the following morning we should
move on a two days' journey to Lobsan's tents, which were
situated on the banks of the River Bayan Gol, where plans
could be better formed for completing this last portion
of our journey. We almost wished we had gone off to
Barong, which lay a few miles south of us. The Tibetan
merchants had told us that we should be able to hire
camels there; but then, again, the Mongols assured us that
although we might be able to hire camels, it was quite
certain that the owners would not venture across the
Bana country with so small a party, and that we should
have to await the arrival of the Tibetan merchants, which
would cause two or three weeks' delay, and perhaps more,
but that if we did not mind that we had better go to
Barong. We decided that our best plan was to stick
to our Mongols, who thus far had treated us so well,
and who, we felt sure, would eventually agree to take
us to China.
</p>

<p>
Our first day lay through a land of thick hermok bushes
and grass, including a sandy plain, the whole party being
mounted on stout ponies. Towards evening we halted by
a spring in a small grassy plain. Here we found other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
Mongols, and it was evident that this spot, called Ootoo,
was a regular camping ground.
</p>

<p>
With the help of a bright moon, we found them before
daybreak loading up the ponies again, and as we continued
our journey through the bush and grass country we saw
several hares, pheasants, and goa. After a couple of miles
we saw Mongol tents for the first time. These tents, which
were made of sticks and thick felt, were of circular shape,
with conical top, and had a small opening for a door.
Scattered around them were numbers of sheep, goats,
cows, ponies, and big black long-haired dogs, whose
bark and attitude, apparently dangerous, were in reality
harmless, for they were generally put to rout by the little
terrier Ruby.
</p>

<p>
After a five hours' ride we halted to graze the ponies on
the banks of a stream called Shishi, which flowed in a
southerly direction and at this time of the year was easily
fordable. We were soon on the move again, for the Mongols
were anxious to reach their tents before nightfall. As we
wended our way through the hermok bushes, Malcolm
and I loitered behind to devour some of their berries. So
busily engaged were we that we forgot how far behind we
were, and on resuming our ride found we had wandered
off the track, and could see no signs of our little party.
</p>

<p>
Separating, and keeping one another in view, we rode on
in what we considered would be the proper direction, riding
up every piece of high ground we came to for a better view.
From one of these eminences Malcolm saw some ponies
grazing in the distance. On our reaching them, they proved
to be ponies belonging to some Mongols living on the banks
of a river. We found there many groups of tents, from
whose owners we learnt that Lobsan lived further up the
river, so knew we had reached the banks of the Bayan
Gol. After passing several other tents with the usual
amount of cattle, we discovered just after sunset that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
Lobsan's tents were situated on the opposite bank. We
found the river some three feet deep and twenty yards
across, and though the water was fairly clear, and flowing
fast, it was safer to cross the river as rapidly as possible, for
otherwise one was liable to sink into the soft mud that lines
the bottom in these parts.
</p>

<p>
Our little camp was already pitched a couple of hundred
yards from Lobsan's tent, and he, good-hearted fellow, was
soon by our side with a supply of good tea and milk, of
which attention and refreshment we showed our approval
by holding up our thumbs and repeating the word "Hoch!
Hoch!"
</p>

<p>
We broke the Sabbath by buying more tsampa and mar.
It was curious to see these people examining each rupee,
those with a crown on the Queen's head being separated
from those without one, the crownless ones being far
more appreciated, for some reason or other we could not
discover.
</p>

<p>
We spent three days by Lobsan's tents, and the better
we became acquainted with these people the more we were
able to testify to their kindly dispositions. Throughout the
stay our camp formed a general place of gathering from
morn till eve, all coming to sight-see, barter, and gossip,
so that we were seldom left to ourselves. Their talk was
principally about "gourmo," which means rupees. They
formed picturesque groups with their beaming faces. All
the men wore black knee-boots, and thick sheepskin cloaks
tucked in at the waist to adjust them to a convenient
length, so as to hang over their breeches of the same
material. These cloaks are generally slipped half off on
a warm day, leaving one arm and part of their body bare.
A leather hat with a white fur rim, and a red or blue top
with a red tassel, was kept in its place by means of a
chin-strap. There were other hats of nondescript shape.
Many of them smoked the long and small-bowled pipe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes they would bring us some fresh article to buy,
notably vermicelli or kua mien from China, and millet, called
"turma" by Mongols and "churma" by Tibetans. They
doubtless led a very happy life, and had but little to think
about. Their wants, in the shape of mutton, milk, grain,
and fruit, were provided with very little labour. Their ponies,
camels, and fat-tailed sheep, both black, white, and brown,
required but little looking after in this peaceful district.
In accordance with the seasons, they move off with their
flocks to the place where we first saw them, or to the good
grazing on the banks of the Namoran Gol. Another home
with stone walls is ready for them a few miles away, in the
village of Kyrma.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon we accepted an invitation from Lobsan to
tea in his family tent. We had to stoop to enter by the
door, which was only four feet high, and made by inserting
two stout beams in the ground, which supported a third
one. The door was closed by letting down a thick piece
of felt.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the tent we found a large shallow saucepan,
which was held up about a foot from the ground by
three iron legs, underneath which was the fire to warm the
tea, and directly above this was a hole in the conical top of
the tent, to let out the smoke. The tent was about twelve
feet in diameter, and the custom is to sit round the tea,
which is brewed for the whole circle. We were soon seated
with the rest of the family, and one old lady, as mistress
of the ceremony, stirred up the boiling tea, and ladled it
out into small bowls for each of us in turn. Together with
our tea was also served a quantity of tsampa and ground
cheese. During this sociable meal others came in to participate
in it, or perhaps more probably to have a closer
inspection of ourselves, while others left to make room.
We, too, were equally interested in scrutinizing the old and
young of both sexes in their own home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After we had drunk as much tea as we could, and more
than was good for us, the old lady produced a large vessel
of curds, a special luxury in honour of ourselves, and I
regret to say that we could not do the justice to it that was
expected from us. After this we were glad to get outside
into the fresh air, for the tent had become very stuffy, and
we both remarked how impossible it would be for the coldest
blast to penetrate so snug a home.
</p>

<p>
Few of these Mongols possessed more than one wife,
though, can a man afford it, there is nothing against his
having two. Our friend Lobsan was of the latter class. A
man is considered rich if he possesses a thousand sheep and
from ten to fifteen ponies. A marriage amongst them is
arranged in the following manner. The would-be husband
sends a friend with a piece of white muslin called a "k'artag"
to the father of the lady, who may either retain it or return
it. Should the former be the case it shows that his suit is
accepted, and the lover at once sends the father presents of
money, wine, etc., and forthwith takes away his bride, and
after much festivity she becomes his wife.
</p>

<p>
Upon the death of a Mongol, the body is laid out in the
open plain for a few days, and a piece of cloth is placed
inside the mouth. During this time birds and dogs enjoy
an unrighteous repast upon the decaying flesh. When the
feast is considered to be completed, friends of the dead body
visit the corpse, and whatever bones are still remaining they
smash up into small pieces and scatter to all quarters, so
that every morsel is carried away, and nothing remains in
the open plains. This accounted for our never finding any
dead man's bones, though we did come across one or two
skulls in good preservation. Tibetans have three different
ways of disposing of their dead, the most usual being to
place the corpse in a squatting position on a hilltop, and
then push it over the edge, so that it finds its own last resting-place,
and becomes food for the birds. Occasionally burning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
is resorted to, and very rarely, in the case of rich people,
burial.
</p>

<p>
Throughout our stay with these people we always found
them cheery, pleasant, and though naturally curious, still
inoffensive. They could not quite grasp what I was up to
when using a sextant in the middle of the day to take our
latitude, but when they were told that I was only doing
prayers, they withdrew.
</p>

<p>
On our third and last day on the banks of the Bayan
Gol, all our arrangements had been completed. Sheep and
other supplies had been bought for a good fortnight, and we
had struck a bargain for our transport. Lobsan was to let
us have five riding ponies and five baggage ponies, to take
us as far as the town of Sining, in the province of Kansu,
a few miles across the border. For this journey of 300
miles we were to pay him twenty rupees a pony, but as we
had not sufficient money with us, for we had spent it nearly
all, we were trusted by Lobsan to pay up the remainder at
Sining. We believed that at that town we should come
across some missionaries.
</p>

<p>
Our Mongols spent most of the last day praying, and as
their priest had foretold that this was a propitious day to
start on, and the one they had chosen was not, Lobsan
came to us, saying that since such was the case they would
like some of our things to load up and march a few
hundred yards up the river, and come back again, so that
they might be able to say they had started on a propitious
day.
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the 1st of October we were ready
to start, but the Mongols caused so many unaccountable
delays, that it was 1 o'clock before we had actually moved
off. The delay was caused chiefly by the Mongol lama, who
came and prayed earnestly with the men who were to
accompany us, and in order that fortune might favour their
venture, incense was burnt and carried round the homes of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
the Mongols, and the ponies that were picked out for the
journey. Our caravan consisted of Lobsan himself and
three of his men, all mounted on ponies, and armed with
two matchlocks and a spear of the extraordinary length
of twenty-five feet. They, in addition to our ten ponies
already mentioned, our flock of ten sheep, with the terrier
Ruby, and our three mules, who marched unloaded, composed
the party.
</p>

<p>
In spite of all the preparations and prayers that had
been held, we moved off quite quietly, without any kind of
demonstration, and, when once the loads had settled down,
we covered ground at the rate of over three miles an hour,
a great improvement on our accustomed pace. They were
all stout ponies, and very fat, from the splendid grazing
they enjoy, for no grain is allowed them.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we had reached a spot called Kanoo, where
we were to halt for the night, the ponies were set free to
graze, before being tied up close to us for the night without
any covering. They were always let loose again with the
first streak of daylight, so that they should not start on the
march with empty stomachs. The Mongols always took
care of their ponies, never losing an opportunity of relieving
them of their loads and feeding them. They also used to
change about: one day a pony would be ridden and the
next he might be carrying a load.
</p>

<p>
The marches had to be regulated according to the water
obtainable. On the third day, after going some six miles,
we hit off the main road that runs from Barong to the
Chinese border-town of Tankar, and whither we were bound.
This track brought us to a clear-flowing rivulet, reminding
us of a trout-stream at home.
</p>

<p>
Here we made a midday two hours' halt. When it was
time to start again, we were astonished at the rapidity with
which the Mongols reloaded their ponies. They were
wonderfully quick and handy, very different from our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
original lot of Argoons from Leh. Their ponies were very
tractable, although ridden with only a snaffle or merely
a headstall; and without ever being shod, they stood the
long marches we made well enough. They were always
marched in one long string. One end of the rope was held
in the hand of one of the mounted men, who led the way,
and the other end passed through the headstall of each of
the ponies in turn. This answers all right, but the animals
can pick up no living as they march. As soon as we had
travelled beyond the neighbourhood of the Bayan Gol,
Lobsan and his men began to show their fears of the Bana
tribes, for he was always begging us to march with our guns
ready, nor to go ahead of, or loiter behind, the party. They
themselves, during the greater part of the day, were praying
aloud as they marched, relieving themselves sometimes by
startling us with a loud, hearty song.
</p>

<p>
After leaving the stream, we came to the entrance of
a narrow gorge, where Lobsan said we must keep our guns
ready, for the Bana men hid behind rocks and appeared
unexpectedly. His fears were increased by the sight of
some croaking ravens. He maintained that the noise they
were making was a bad omen, and to counteract the effect
one of the old muzzle-loaders was placed on its stand and
fired at the birds, but of course with no fatal results, for the
croaking was redoubled, and we continued our ascent of the
gorge. We then crossed a small plateau, and before entering
another gorge we came to a stream, whose water they never
drink, for it is considered a deadly poison to both man and
beast. Although the water was quite clear, it tasted as
though there was soda in it. On account of this poisonous
stream, we had to make a ten hours' march before reaching
any other water. Towards sunset we emerged into an open
plain, and riding on a few miles we came to a spring and
fruit bushes, evidently a haunt of bears, for one fine black
fellow quickly made away towards the hills on our approach.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Some distance off in this plain of Noring Hol lay a salt
lake, on whose further banks were the remains of two
villages. These had been till lately Mongol homes, but the
owners had fled in fear and deserted them on the approach
of the Mohammedan rebels of Kansu, some of whom fled
this way into Turkistan, after they had been defeated by
the Chinese.
</p>

<p>
In this neighbourhood we saw for the first time the crests
of hills covered with pine trees. Sometimes encampments
are made in the valleys, and articles are made from the
wood.
</p>

<p>
On the seventh day of our march we came to the spot, on
the banks of the Tuling Gol, where lately there must have
been a very considerable encampment. The posts to which
the owners had tethered their animals still remained.
Various articles lay scattered about, and the number of
large fireplaces that had been built, testified to the numbers
of the encampers. Here we learnt a small Chinese army
had halted, in their pursuit of the Mohammedans fleeing into
Turkistan.
</p>

<p>
Two more miles beyond this we came to a miserable
village, Tuling, or Selling Gompa. This was quite the
dirtiest and most dilapidated collection of houses that either
of us had ever seen, or want to see again. All the inhabitants
were either blind or lame or diseased in some shape or
form, and, clad in filthy rags, they lay about basking in the
sun and dirt. The big black dogs, blear-eyed and mangy,
that crawled about, were well suited to the place. It was
an asylum for all lepers, cripples, and other sufferers of
these districts. It was close to this village that the French
traveller, De Trouille de Rhins, had met an untimely end.
</p>

<p class="caption">MONGOL CAMP: ONE OF OUR HALTS.</p>
</div>

<p>
At this point there are two roads to China, one branching
off half right, and the other half left. The former passes
through a district from which much salt is obtained; it is
a shorter but rougher road, and according to our Mongols
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
a more dangerous one. They therefore elected to travel by
the other. There was a green valley up which the shorter
road led, where we could see numbers of black tents of the
Bana tribes, and their immense flocks of sheep, their cattle,
tame yak, and ponies.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of one white tent, all these Bana tents
were as black as could be. The roofs of them were for the
most part octagonal, with a hole in the middle to release
the smoke. To each corner a rope is attached, which is
fastened to a stick driven into the ground, and this again
is kept secure by another rope attached to a peg.
</p>

<p>
Now that we had come well into the midst of the Bana
tribes, the Mongols' fears were redoubled, and they kept
watch throughout the night. Soon after sunset they
made up a number of big fires, so that we might represent
a large camp, and in order to accustom their ponies to
the noise of an attack, they rehearsed one, pretending
that imaginary enemies had fallen upon us. They fired
off their old matchlocks, and rushed here and there, crying
out, "Ho! Hi!" We sat by a large fire of argols
warming our toes, as we watched the performance, unwilling
to help them with our guns in the terrible battle they were
engaged in. As soon as they had beaten off the foe, they,
our men, and ourselves, formed the three points of a triangle,
and picketing the ponies in our middle, slept soundly
throughout the night, without further disturbance from real
or imaginary enemies.
</p>

<p>
Some ten miles from this camp we found a wonderful
rock, standing out conspicuous and alone in the grassy
valley we were marching down. On one side of this rock
a small open courtyard had been built from big blocks of
white stone, some of which were a foot deep and broad, and
two feet long. The walls were some twelve feet high, while
the courtyard itself was about twelve yards long and eight
yards broad. On many of the stones were Chinese, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
a few Tibetan, inscriptions, and on the interstices between
two of them we found a Chinese cash. Hanging across one
wall was a piece of rope, and attached to this were any
number of hairs from horses' tails and shoulder-bones with
inscriptions on them. Just as I had managed to cut
off one of these bones unobserved, the whole rope, with
all its attachments, fell to the ground. The Mongols at that
moment entered, and although I concealed my bone, it was
still a question whether they suspected me of the deed;
however, very little harm was done, for they replaced the
rope in its former position. Having entered the courtyard,
we found a large cave some thirty feet high, and of the same
diameter, inside the rock. But even still more remarkable
than the cave itself is the entrance here of a subterranean
passage, running all the way to the salt lake of Koko Nor.
This wonderful place and the courtyard is said to have
been the work of some superhuman agency, for the stones
of the wall itself are considered to be too big and heavy
for any mortal man to have placed there. The place is
called Kanjur Rungyum, which means "sacred writings,
not built by men."
</p>

<p>
At midday we halted by a small stream at the foot of a
pass, called the Nicotine Kontal, so that the ponies might
rest an hour or two before making the ascent. Our Mongols,
for ever thinking of their Bana enemies, determined to
improve the hour by a little target practice. It was a slow
process, loading with powder and an irregular-shaped piece
of lead, which was shoved down with a wooden ramrod,
then placing the powder at the touch-hole, preparing the
fuse, and resting the gun on the wooden rail which they raised
to sight the gun before finally applying the fuse. They
made far better practice at the target, which was 150 yards
off, than we had anticipated.

<p class="caption">THREE REMAINING MULES AT KOKO NOR.</p>
</div>

<p>
After crossing this easy pass we travelled through a
country of grass, and on the ninth day of our march saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
in the distance the small hill, with its cairn called Hatuturgy
on top, that lies at the western end of the large lake of Koko
Nor. The following day we found the country inhabited by
more Bana people living in their black tents; they were
dotted about all over the land, with immense flocks of sheep
and countless herds of tame yak.
</p>

<p>
That night was the coldest we experienced during our
journey. There were twenty-seven degrees (Fahr.) of frost,
but, although we were sleeping on the ground without any
tent, our slumbers were sounder than they sometimes are in
a bed of luxury.
</p>

<p>
We journeyed along the northern shore of this inland
sea, for people in China, when visiting the Koko Nor, talk
of spending a week at the sea. This salt lake is about
230 miles round, with a few small islands. By reason of
its colour it is called the Blue Lake or Koko Nor.
</p>

<p>
As we marched along all day we overtook large herds of
yak being driven to the Chinese markets, laden with salt
or wool. At midday we made our halt by one of the
several streams that run into the lake from the ranges of
hills. At night-time it was impossible to find a spot which
would be out of sight of these black tents. This induced
our Mongols to take more precautions than ever for their
safety.
</p>

<p>
Much to their dismay, we agreed that I should ride
on ahead the following morning with Esau the last hundred
miles or so to the Chinese border town of Tankar. We knew
how well Rockhill had been received at the little inn there,
and I hoped that I should come across Tibetans who would
help us to arrange for our onward journey through China.
I hoped to have all ready by the time Malcolm arrived with
the Mongols.

CHAPTER XXII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
ESAU AND I SET OFF—RECEPTION FROM THE BANAS—WE ARRIVE
AT TANKAR—A FRIENDLY GUIDE—AN ABSURD TIP—DR. RIJNHART—TEA
WITH LHASSA OFFICIALS—ARRIVAL OF MALCOLM
AND THE MONGOLS—CHEN-LAO-PAN—CHINESE ETIQUETTE.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak on the 12th October, Esau and I, after filling
ourselves with tea and tsampa, mounted the strongest two
of the Mongol ponies. Our saddlebags were filled with food
such as we had eaten at breakfast and a supply of cold meat.
We also carried some rugs, for it was probable that we
should have to spend two more nights in the wilds before
reaching Tankar.
</p>

<p>
After riding some ten miles quietly over the prairie land,
we entered a large camp of Bana men, with whom were
living several lamas, who came out to inquire who we
might be and were friendly enough in their conversation;
most of the Bana men were away tending their flocks.
</p>

<p>
We rode on again for a considerable distance before we
could find the wherewithal to boil some tea. There were
the remnants of a very old Mongol encampment, where we
gathered together some argols and a few sticks, and close by
was water in the shape of a patch of snow, which even then
had not melted. Before leaving we made an erection of
mud, into which we placed a stick with a note fastened to it.
This was to let Malcolm know that we were getting along
all right.
</p>

<p>
We rode on till late in the afternoon, when we came to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
the foot of a pass which forms the watershed of the Koko
Nor and the Sining Ho. Here were grass, water, and dried
argols, and fearing darkness might be on us before we could
cross the pass, we unsaddled and prepared to spend the
night. A few miles south of us lay the small salt lake of
Baga Nor, quite close to the Koko Nor; to the west of us
there were large camps of the Bana men, who were ignorant
of our existence, for we had encamped in a depression of
the ground and our two ponies grazed in secrecy.
</p>

<p>
While Esau was busy preparing the tea I collected a
large sack of argols, that we might keep up a fire throughout
the night, for there was a bitterly cold wind which blew down
upon us from the north-east.
</p>

<p>
We saddled our ponies early the next morning, and found
we had a nine-mile ride before reaching the top of the pass.
There were two passes some five or six miles apart, and here
were living more Bana people, with immense flocks as usual.
It was certainly a chilly abode at this time of the year. We
experienced this to our discomfort, for we were caught in
a heavy snowstorm. At the second pass we met a large
party of Tibetan lamas dressed in gay garments of red and
yellow, the colours standing out particularly bright against
the falling snow.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we commenced the descent we followed a
small stream, the Sining Ho, and after twenty-two miles
stopped to make tea in a large grassy valley dotted with
more black tents and flocks. Whilst busily engaged with
our breakfast an old shepherd came to see us, from whom
we inquired whether we could reach Tankar that same
evening. "Yes," he replied, "if your ponies are good
enough, you will get there this evening," which was
certainly wisdom.
</p>

<p>
We journeyed on till after sunset with no signs of Tankar;
we had still followed the Sining Ho, which flowed between
precipitous hills, with only space enough for the narrow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
track on its right bank. We were just moving along looking
for a suitable camp when we found a few more Bana tents
in front of us. Our reception was anything but civil, and
we had some anxiety that the nomads might steal our ponies
during the night, for it was impossible for us to travel along
in the dark. We chose a spot on the lower ground by the
water's edge, out of sight, and met with no mishap. With
the first streak of daylight we were drinking our tea, and
were soon on the move again. After marching for one mile
we had to cross the river, which, by reason of the recent
storms, had swollen considerably, and a dry passage could
not be made; the water rose up over our ponies' hips, and
the bottom of the river was uneven and uncertain, with big
boulders.
</p>

<p>
We then entered what is called the grass country,
whither the inhabitants of Tankar send their flocks to
fatten. After six miles we passed a compact little village
planted on the other side of the river. The land here and
all down the river had been cultivated, in fact, every inch
of ground. Some of the crops grew close up by the walls
of the village, while others grew on the hillsides and slopes,
where it looked impossible for crops to grow. Most of them
had been cut, and the villagers in their blue garments were
busily engaged in gathering them in.
</p>

<p>
We still followed the stream, the pathway being uneven
with rocks and boulders, whilst the hills on our side rose
close from the water's edge. After a short while we came
to a pretty rustic-looking bridge, which invited one over
the river to a snug monastery that nestled amongst the
trees and bushes. The name of this monastery is Gompa
Soba, and had I followed my own inclination and visited
the place, kindness and hospitality would alone have been
exhibited, as we afterwards learnt.
</p>

<p>
From here the road to Tankar, such as it is, passes
through a cultivated district with a continuation of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
straggling villages and tall poplars. Being very hungry,
and over-anxious to reach Tankar, the road in consequence
appeared to be interminable. Perhaps this is what made
Rockhill state that the distance from Tankar to Gompa
Soba was thirteen miles, whereas, in reality, it is not much
more than half the distance.
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded, the number of passers-by increased,
and they appeared to take as much interest in little Ruby
as they did in Esau and myself.
</p>

<p>
I told Esau to address some of these people in the
Tibetan language, to try and find out how much further
Tankar was, and any other information about the place.
Many were thus accosted, and many without success, till
at length we met a nice-looking elderly Chinaman, who
was a merchant. He told us, to our great delight and
astonishment, that there were two white doctors, one a
lady, living at Tankar. He also told us of the little inn
where we could get some sort of accommodation.
</p>

<p>
It was noon when we at length entered the town by the
western gate, a great relief to our weary ponies. We began
to ride through the main street, busy, dirty, and narrow,
with a large crowd of Chinese, and a sprinkling of Mongols
and Tibetans too. As we wended our way, observed by all,
I told Esau to shout out in the Tibetan tongue for somebody
to show us the way to the inn. Without avail
we traversed the whole length of Tankar, and then tried
a new expediency. We retraced our steps as far as the
busiest corner we had seen, and calling a halt there,
Esau in a loud voice again and again repeated the
question.
</p>

<p>
This proceeding of ours naturally attracted a large crowd,
and so pressed were we on all sides, that I thought it wise
to back out of it. As soon as we had almost got ourselves
clear, we found a man alongside of us who replied in
Tibetan, "I'll show you the way to the inn." I smiled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
and nodded in acknowledgment of his kindness, and we
moved off, followed by a crowd filled with wonderment
as to where we had sprung from, especially as we were
unaccompanied by any following or baggage animals.
</p>

<p>
We very shortly entered the door of the inn, which we
found consisted of a very dirty square yard surrounded on all
sides by stables or tiny rooms void of any furniture. Having
been so far successful in finding it, the next thing was
to procure food for the ponies and then for ourselves.
Curiously enough, I could discover no innkeeper, for I had
hoped to find a hearty welcome from the same man who
had helped Rockhill, but what I considered of more importance
at that moment was the discovery of a small stack of
green grass at the further end of the yard. I at once went
for it and began pulling out some of the grass, but this
operation did not last very long, for I was caught hold of
from all sides and was given to understand that the grass
was not for my use. Just then our Tibetan speaking friend
returned, whom I sent with Esau carrying a rupee to try and
buy some grass. Now that I was left alone with Ruby we
both attracted much attention from the people, all of whom,
in turn, felt my hat, my coat, and my pants, to see of what
material they were made, whilst others still more inquisitive
felt my knees, for a Chinaman imagines we are blessed
with no knee-caps. Esau was not long away, but had been
unsuccessful on his errand, for no one would change the
rupee because there was a crown on the Queen's head. I
therefore selected a crownless one, which was more suited to
their taste. This very soon produced a bundle of hay and a
handful of small brass coins called "cash." This was, indeed,
a windfall, and we felt we already had a firmer footing in
the land. As a matter of fact, the few rupees we had left
were not sufficient to pay off our Mongols, so without
assistance we should have fared badly. Our friend then
volunteered to run off and tell the white man of my arrival.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
He could not have lived very far away, for he was soon
back again.
</p>

<p>
I then ordered Esau to reward the Chinaman for all the
trouble he had taken for us, so Esau, straightway pulling
forth his coins, offered him a single cash. To our surprise
he declined it with a smile, while Esau and I
remarked that these Chinese were by no means the money-loving
race they were generally represented to be. The
narration of our first experience in Chinese money matters
caused many a laugh amongst the good missionaries we
afterwards came across, for the man we had offered a
single cash to was a merchant of Tankar of no small importance,
whilst the value of a single cash is equal to about
the thirtieth portion of a penny. One might as well have
offered sixpence to a head keeper at home after a big
shoot.
</p>

<p>
I was just about to sally forth to try and purchase some
bread, for I had noticed some at the corner only a short
distance from the inn, when some one hurriedly trotted in
and at once dismounted from his pony. He was somewhat
better dressed than the ordinary crowd around, and on
seeing me he came straight towards me. I could hardly
make up my mind whether he was a European or a Chinaman,
and when he addressed me in a mixture of French and
Chinese I was still more mystified, so to simplify matters
I replied, "I'm an Englishman," and held my hand out
to him. He eagerly seized it and gave me the heartiest
shake I had received for many a long day, and I felt
thankful that we had found a European and a friend anxious
to help us in this out-of-the-way place.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rijnhart, for that was his name, was a Dutch missionary,
and had only taken up his abode in Tankar within
the last three months. He said, "You must come at once
and live with me and my wife." In thanking him, I replied
that it was impossible for me to do that, for I had nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
but what was on my back. With genuine hospitality he
remarked that if such was the case it was more imperative
than ever that I should come and live in his house. In
another moment we were trotting through the street in
single file, chatting all the while, when, suddenly turning
to the left, we very shortly afterwards drew up at Rijnhart's
little house. One step up out of the narrow lane landed
us in an open courtyard, where his kind-hearted wife,
Dr. Rijnhart, was waiting to welcome us, as well as
Mr. Hall, of the China Inland Mission, who had come over
to Tankar from Sining, and had only just returned with
the Rijnharts from making a trip to the sea of Koko Nor.
So it was indeed fortunate not to have arrived in Tankar
during their absence. The Rijnharts had a small house;
there were rooms and stables all round the four sides of
the yard. Great honour was shown to me in the eyes of
the Chinese by allotting to my use the room that faced the
entrance. The Rijnharts, when by themselves, lived in
Chinese fashion, and were on the most friendly terms with
all the Chinese and Tibetan officials in the town. Besides
being engaged in the great aim of all missionaries, these
two good people administered bodily medicine as well; in
fact, their sole means of existence arose from the small
sums and kind they received in return. They were, indeed,
leading a hard, unselfish life, yet they were a very happy
couple, for they knew they were doing good.
</p>

<p>
The fact of their receiving payment for their doctoring
may meet with censure from some people, but the results
should be looked at. At Tankar the Rijnharts had entirely
won over the hearts of the Chinese, and in consequence
of this, we ourselves were treated with courtesy and civility
by the officials. The customary hatred of foreigners by the
Chinese had disappeared from Tankar.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon some Lhassa officials dropped in for
a chat and a cup of tea, or, more correctly speaking, a small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
bowl of tea. They were pleasant fellows with nice faces,
and had been stationed at Tankar to see that justice was
done to all Tibetans passing through this frontier town.
There were four officials altogether, the most influential
being called Sherchichaba, and the fourth Lusam Kindum.
They took great interest in our journey, and were evidently
pleased to meet me.
</p>

<p>
When they had departed, a very stout and hearty Chinaman
stepped in. He was Chen-Lao-Pan, an agent for
Forbes &amp; Co., the wool merchants. He could only speak a
few words of English, but as he laughed so frequently and so
heartily, there was no feeling of awkwardness when with
him. That night the many little homely comforts attended
to by Dr. Rijnhart herself were highly appreciated by me,
and I slept soundly.
</p>

<p>
The next morning we had leisure to look round before
the arrival of Malcolm with the Mongols. Tankar is a
busy little town of some 10,000 inhabitants, and owes its
importance, not to its being a market centre, but to the fact
that it is the first and last Chinese town passed by caravans
journeying to and from Lhassa and Mongolia. It is a kind
of depôt, for the merchandise is taken further in to the
larger towns. We walked through the main street, and
peeped into all the shops, most of which contained nick-nacks
and a great deal of rubbish. We then mounted
the walls on the western side, and noticed that great
heaps of stones had been collected there for the people to
throw down on to the heads of the Mohammedan rebels.
Several mud houses had also been erected, where the soldiers
had to sleep and keep watch in turn. From these walls
a fine view of the surrounding country is gained. Tankar
appears to be situated in a kind of hollow, with rising
ground and hills on all sides. One of the principal hills
lies north-west, and is called Ho La, or Ta Sand, and
another hill lying south-east is called Ts'ai T'a by Tartars
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
and Wupu by Tibetans. From the summit of one of the
south-eastern hills, where a single tree has been planted,
the town of Sining can be seen, a distance of ninety li.
This tree is a useful landmark for travellers, as it can be
seen for a long distance along the road. We could see, too,
the river, which is here called the Ta Ho by the Chinese,
and Ch'enkook by Mongols of the Tsaidam, running merrily
through a land of cultivation, the most plentiful crops being
wheat, barley, oats, millet, pease, and a little linseed and
opium.
</p>

<p>
We had no sooner returned to Rijnhart's little house when
Malcolm and the Mongols arrived, so our party was once
more reunited. Since leaving Leh we had travelled over
1,983 miles, and for between three and four months had
been at a height of about 1,600 feet above the sea level.
In spite of the pressing invitations of our hosts, we decided
to remain only one day at Tankar. It was now the middle
of October, and before very long the severe winter of these
parts would be upon us; furthermore, we were already due
back in India some six weeks ago. We agreed to make the
most of our short stay, so in the afternoon we visited the
Yamen, in order to pay our respects to the "ting," or mayor,
of Tankar. We spent some minutes in the first outer courtyard,
which was decorated with some huge imitation stone
lions, while our visiting card was being taken to this chief
official. The people, as usual, took advantage of the delay
to feel and inspect our clothes, and the state they were in
would alone have warranted this scrutiny, let alone the
curiosity these people exhibited with regard to the texture
of the cloth. We were glad at length to escape and be
ushered into the presence of the "ting," where all respect
and attention was shown to us. We were given the great
seat of honour, and provided with some delightful tea.
We apologised for the dilapidated state we were in, but
the "ting" replied that he had carefully read our passport,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
and knew we were great military officials from India, and
quite understood our present circumstances; in fact, he
wondered we had arrived with anything at all. Whilst
chatting away, we inquired how many soldiers were in the
town. None now, he replied, for all had been disbanded
since the rebellion had been quelled. When our visit had
lasted as long as was polite, we rose to depart, and the
"ting," in order to show his great respect for us, accompanied
us as far as the big gates, walking at a slow rate. These
had been thrown open wide, as a still further sign of respect,
where, amidst much bowing and raising of the hands to
the head, we eventually got off.
</p>

<p>
We then made our way to the house of the Hsieht'ai, or
Colonel, and why there should be a Colonel with no
soldiers seemed ridiculous. However, this was no business
of ours, but as he was the next important official in
Tankar, it was our duty to visit him. He was a rather
enfeebled, elderly gentleman, but very kind to us, and
that very evening we received presents from him, consisting
of a sheep for ourselves, and grass and liou or pease
for our ponies. He asked many questions with regard
to the Indian revenue, its army, etc., and asked how
many men we ourselves commanded, and, in order to do
ourselves justice, we calculated a single Englishman was
equal to a great number of Chinamen, which he evidently
did not.
</p>

<p>
Our third visit was to Chen-Lao-Pan, who lived in luxury
and comfort and on the fat of the land. He sent us forth
rejoicing with a bottle of Chinese wine and a packet of
tobacco from Lancheo, the capital of Kansu, so famous for
its tobacco grown and manufactured there.
</p>

<p>
At afternoon tea it is polite manners for the host to take
some bread or cake from the guest's plate and place it on
the table before him, and before drinking tea to raise the
cup in both hands and nod to one's friends, who return the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
salutation in the same manner. It is also considered
polite for a guest, when offered the seat of honour, to refuse
it, when the host will at once try and put his guest into it.
A show of resistance is at once made in return. The
consequence is, that before the seat is eventually occupied
by the guest, as it always is, a struggle of a few minutes
duration is carried out against its occupation.

CHAPTER XXIII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
A VISIT TO CHEN-LAO-PAN—COLONEL YANG—THE DAUGHTER OF
PRINCE KOKO NOR—A VISIT TO THE MONASTERY OF KUMBUM.
</p>

<p>
The following morning we visited the Lhassa officials, but
unfortunately found only one of them at home, Lusam
Kindum, who was very friendly, and at once plied us with
tea. He said that he himself was shortly going to Pekin
with the big triennial tribute to the Emperor, consisting of
pulo cloth, saffron, and incense. He showed us a rifle of
German make which he had bought from one of the
soldiers during the rebellion for eighteen taels, or £3 12s.
</p>

<p>
We made Lusam Kindum a small present of a knife,
and he in return presented Malcolm with a beautifully
embroidered golden cap such as he himself wore, and to me
gave a "scarf of blessing," or k'artag, under which it was
given, and I in return held this up to my forehead with a
gentle nod. He, too, came down from the "k'ang" and
accompanied us as far as the gates, which were opened in
our honour.
</p>

<p>
We again visited Chen-Lao-Pan, where the "ting" and
the Colonel turned up, so that the conversation and laughter
waxed strong and loud, while the tea, the cakes, and pipes
were liberally distributed. All knew that Chen-Lao-Pan possessed
the best of everything, and was liberal with it withal.
To add to the gathering, the Colonel's two little daughters,
both well dressed, were trotted in to pay their respects.
They must have been very young, for they were very little,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
and could scarcely walk, yet they made their curtseys
all round in the most polite fashion, showing at what an
early age the better educated Chinese are taught to a nicety
the correct manners of society. As soon as the mayor and
the Colonel, whose name was Yang, and his two little
daughters had departed, we set about business, and the
object of our second visit. This was the loan of some
money to help us across China. Nothing could have delighted
more the heart of this good-natured Chinaman than
his freely lending us sixty taels, as well as giving us letters
of credit to other agents throughout the country. Nor
could we thank him sufficiently for the kind help he
had given us. The lack of money at this time was our
greatest difficulty. How could we cross China when we were
penniless?

During the afternoon the Rijnharts were visited by the
daughter of the Prince of Koko Nor. She was so splendidly
dressed that I could not resist taking a snap-shot of her
whilst being engaged in conversation with Dr. Rijnhart.
We were sorry at having to leave Tankar on the morrow,
especially as Rijnhart himself was coming with us and
we were leaving his good wife to live alone; but we were
thankful to know that in this busy little town the greatest
officials were her staunchest friends.

<p class="center">
<i>A Visit to the Monastery of Kumbum.</i>
</p>

<p>
About 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on October 17th, after having said "Good-bye"
to Dr. Rijnhart, our hospitable hostess of the last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
few days, and having sent off our baggage by the direct
road to Sining, we started for the famous monastery of
Kumbum, which lies about seventy li south-east of Tankar.
Our party consisted of Mr. Peter Rijnhart, our two selves,
and Lassoo, the cook. We rode our Mongol ponies, on which
we fastened our saddlebags, with all that we were likely
to require.
</p>

<p>
Very lucky we were to be able to pay this visit under
the guidance of Mr. Rijnhart, for not only has he a more
intimate knowledge of the monastery than any other living
man, but having made his home for two years in Lusar,
ten months of which were spent in the monastery itself, he
has made friends with a very large number of its inmates,
more especially with Mina Fu-yeh, one of the greatest incarnate
saints in the place,<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> in whose house we were to spend
the night. Just outside the east gate of Tankar we passed
a party of Tibetans, in the midst of whom was a big living
Buddha, who had recently been appointed abbot of the
monastery of Ta Koe Ri by the Talé Lama. On his way
from Lhassa he had been attacked by a party of Mohammedans.
All his attendants had been killed, and he alone
had escaped to the mountains, where he wandered about
for twenty-three days without food, till at last he found
his way to Tankar. He was now on his way to take up
his appointment, having recovered from the effects of his
privations.

</div>

<p>
For the first fifteen li our road lay along the left bank of
the Hsi Ho, till we crossed it by a bridge close to the village
of Hsang Ho Ri (Sounding River). On the way we overtook
strings of camels laden with the yearly tribute of
pulo and incense from the Talé Lama to the Emperor.
We noticed several caves in the cliffs inhabited by men—fortunate
beings, for they had no rent to pay. At Hsang
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
Ho Ri is a small inn where flour and tea can be bought,
and close by were some opium fields. This bridge was one
of the many in Kansu which are built on the cantilever
principle. They are plentiful throughout the Western
Himalayas, but this was the first we had seen in China.
We now had a stiffish climb to the top of a pass called the
Wu La, whence we got a magnificent view over range after
range of mountains, stretching away to the south. The
descent was comparatively easy, and we were able to note
the results of the recent Mohammedan rebellion. Every
village that was not in ruins had loop-holed walls and
fighting towers which had been specially erected. Our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
companion, Rijnhart, had spent some time in General
Wei's<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> camp, he and his wife doctoring the wounded,
thereby saving many a life, and earning the gratitude of
their patients. He was, therefore, well qualified to point
out various spots along our road where skirmishes or serious
fighting had taken place. Many of the villages had been
deserted, but the people were now returning, and beginning
to again get their fields under cultivation. It will, however,
be many a long day before grain and market produce regain
their normal price. Rich and fertile though this little bit
of Kansu is, it will be fully two years before it can recover
from the trying times it passed through in 1895.

<p>
Once, just about sunset, we missed our way, and once
one of the horses, while being led, slipped down a steep
bank into a ravine, luckily without injuring himself or
any one else. Otherwise our ride was devoid of incident,
but the moon was high in the heavens by the time we
arrived at our destination. We were quite unexpected,
so it was some time before we could get any one to pay
attention to our knocking at the stout wooden doors of the
monastery; but at length it was opened by one of the great
man's servants, who, as soon as he recognised Mr. Rijnhart,
was all civility. The door we went in at was not the front
door, as only the owner of the house was supposed to use
that, and it would have been a great breach of etiquette on
our part to have gone in by it. Our door led us into the
stable yard, and while word was being taken to Mina Fu-yeh
that Mr. Rijnhart, or Lin Hsien-shêng, as he was generally
called, had arrived with two foreign friends, we busied ourselves
looking after the horses, loosening girths, getting
straw, etc. In a few moments we went upstairs, and, after
passing through an open court ornamented in the middle
with a flower bed, were ushered into the presence of one of
the holiest men on the eastern border of Tibet.

<p class="caption">MINA FU-YEH (BUDDHA).</p>
</div>

<p>
Mina Fu-yeh<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> is a man twenty-seven years of age, or
twenty-eight by Chinese calculation, and has been in the
monastery since he was seven. Considerably below medium
height, and of slight build, he has a very pleasant face,
especially when lit up by a happy smile, as it often is. It
struck us both that the sedentary indoor life he is more or
less bound to live was telling on his constitution, and that
if he had spent more of his time in the open air, instead of
in reading, writing, and meditation, his health would benefit
greatly. However that may be, it did not interfere with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
his hospitality, for the moment we were seated he told us
that food was being prepared, and that it would shortly be
ready. He was living in a small room about twelve feet
square, with massive stone walls, squatting on the "k'ang"
or raised platform which occupied the greater portion of the
room. On this "k'ang" was a low square table only a few
inches high, holding a beautiful tea-cup made of stone, with
a silver cover. On his right was a darkly-stained cupboard,
wherein he kept his books, writing materials, and other nick-nacks.
Hanging on the wall opposite him, and in no way
harmonising with the other surroundings, was a coloured
picture of the day illustrating some English boys and girls
out of school. This had been given him by Mr. Rijnhart,
who meanwhile told him all about us—who we were, where
we had come from, and gave him a general outline of our
journey, in all of which he took considerable interest, and,
through Rijnhart, he asked us several questions, including
the inevitable one, "Aren't you cold in those thin clothes?"
No Chinaman or Tibetan seems able to grasp the European
fashion of wearing tight clothing; to them our outer clothes
appear to fit so closely that there can be no room for any
underneath.
</p>

<p>
Mina Fu-yeh speaks Chinese, Mongolian, and Tibetan
with equal ease and fluency, so that any questions we
wished to ask we put to Rijnhart, who translated them into
Chinese, the answer being received the reverse way. In
this manner we were able to get a reliable statement about
the priests who live on the "Dragon Colt's Island," the
island in the Koko Nor, mention of which has been made
by so many travellers. While marching along the north
shore of the lake, we had just been able to make out the
island away towards the south side, but no two men gave
the same account of its inhabitants. Mina Fu-yeh said that
there are twelve or thirteen priests living there, that they
keep sheep and goats, and that, being free from depredations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
of wolves, their flocks thrive well. In winter, when the lake
is frozen over, they cross to the mainland and lay in stores
for the following summer. He himself, he added, was
thinking of building a house there and getting a boat of
some sort, so that he would be able to go backwards and
forwards at any time of year. I don't suppose this idea of
his will ever come to anything.
</p>

<p>
One was naturally diffident about asking a perfect
stranger a great deal about his religious tenets, for although
our host was a very liberal-minded man and far more
ready to converse than most Tibetans, there was always
the feeling that one might touch on some delicate subject
and quite unintentionally annoy him. We therefore contented
ourselves with asking Rijnhart privately what he had told
him on other occasions. His explanation of how he came
to be recognised as the reincarnation of the previous Mina
Fu-yeh shows how convincing the proofs of identity are to
one who has been brought up to accept and believe in the
theory. He relates how, when very small, various articles
were laid out from which he was to select those which had
been his own in his previous life-time. Among these was a
number of rosaries from which he had no difficulty in choosing
his own, "For," he says, "I had used it daily for years;
how is it possible that I should not know it from among all
these others? Of course I knew it." So on with other
articles; his identity was established without a doubt, and
he became the heir to the accumulated property of fifteen
former lifetimes.<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> He talks freely of his last lifetime, pointing
out the site of the house in which he lived, and which
was burnt down about two years before his death; it was,
he says, a far finer house than the one he now occupies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In the course of conversation, he told us that he had
spent some time in studies at Pekin, and that he had also
been on a journey to the Eastern Mongols, where he read
the sacred books to all who wished it. He selected them as
they were more pious and more wealthy than the Tibetans
or Western Mongols. While in Pekin he had had some
dealings with foreigners, buying things in the stores, and
was full of admiration for their honesty. He was much
amused when we told him we were sorry we could not say
the same for the Chinese. Most of his own people, those
for whose spiritual welfare he is chiefly responsible, come
from round Kuei-Tê, where he himself was born; he has
also a certain number of Tibetans and Mongols from the
Koko Nor and Tsaidam. He was till recently Ta K'anpo
or abbot of the monastery, a position of great dignity, being
in fact the principal official.
</p>

<p>
All officials are elected for a period of three years, and
the abbot during that time has a very peculiar privilege.
He is allowed to send out eight parties of priests in different
directions for three months carrying with them Ts.2,000
worth of merchandise. This they trade for sheep, cattle,
horses, etc., which are sold at considerable profit on their
return. All this profit goes into the pocket of the abbot, who
runs no risk beyond the Ts.2,000 originally invested. All
other expenses are defrayed out of the monastery funds.
</p>

<p>
Mina Fu-yeh had been most unfortunate in his business
matters while abbot, for in 1894 he had sold a great proportion
of his horses, etc., to Mohammedans. They, in
accordance with the universal Chinese custom, deferred
payment till New Year's Day, by which time the rebellion
had broken out, some of his debtors had been killed, and
others had left the country, so that he only collected a tithe
of what was due to him; in 1895 no party was sent out,
owing to the disturbed state of the country, and in 1896 he
had only sent out Ts.1,000 worth of stuff. With this he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
done extremely well, but only made sufficient profit to cover
his losses of 1894.<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
While we had been conversing thus, our food, tea and
large quantities of boiled mutton, was being prepared and was
now brought in, a large dishful for the three of us, and a
separate smaller dish for our host, as is only fitting for one
who lives in such an odour of sanctity as he does.
</p>

<p>
We were very hungry after our ride, and in a few moments
we were busy eating Tibetan fashion, <i>i.e.</i>, pocket-knives and
fingers, each one selecting from the joint whatever morsel
took his fancy; to do the thing properly each bone should
be scraped scrupulously clean, but, though we did our best,
our host could give us points at this. The ease and rapidity
with which he cleaned up the most awkward-looking bones
came as a revelation. As a matter of fact he had already had
his evening meal, but etiquette compelled him to eat again
to encourage us. We were waited upon by the treasurer of
the establishment and by a jolly little boy, about twelve
years old, a disciple of Mina Fu-yeh's, under whose tuition
he was studying the sacred writings. In the intervals of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
filling up our bowls with tea and pressing food upon us, he
amused himself and the company by teasing his teacher's
dog, a very fat little Pekin pug, as it lay beside its master.
</p>

<p>
When we had eaten our fill we rose to say "Good-night,"
and apologised for having thrust ourselves in without due
notice, having come, too, just when our host must have
been about to go to bed. To this he replied that he was
delighted that we had come, that he hoped that we would go
all over the place, taking pictures if we wished to. The priests
would be occupied in public reading in the big hall, but we
should be free to go where we wished; he added that he was
only writing extracts from the books when we came in, and
that we had not disturbed him at all.
</p>

<p>
Of course we asked if we might see his writing, and when
produced we were most unfeignedly astonished by it. Never
have I seen more beautifully even writing, or better formed
characters. Every here and there a word was written in red
ink. On asking why this was we were told that it was the
character for "Sum," or three, and stood for the Trinity of
Buddha.
</p>

<p>
It was very late, so having again said "Good-night," we
went to bed and slept soundly. The next morning we were
up betimes, as we had a busy day before us. At daybreak
we were awakened by hearing two short blasts from a long
horn, followed by a louder blast which was dwelt upon till
it gradually died away. This was the warning to the 4,000
priests at Kumbum to get ready for prayer; it was the commencement
of a new day. But, early as we were, our host
was before us, and when we left our room we found him
making preparations for breakfast. He explained that his
steward and several of his servants were away, so he had
to do a great deal himself. It seemed strange to see an
incarnate saint, who is held in the deepest reverence and
worshipped by men, busying himself unlocking drawers,
producing sugar and butter, and generally attending to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
most trivial and mundane matters, chattering away all the
time like an ordinary mortal.
</p>

<p>
Thanks, however, to these endeavours, our breakfast of
tea and tsamba was soon ready. Rijnhart, of course, is an
adept at mixing up the butter, meal, and sugar into the
correct dough, but neither of us had acquired the art. For
some time our host watched us in silence, smiling occasionally
at our awkwardness, but at last he offered to do it for
us, adding hastily to Rijnhart, "Please tell them my hands
are quite clean." Breakfast over, we lost no time in starting,
armed with the kodak, to visit the many temples and
shrines which form the monastery.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived the previous evening, it was too dark to
get any idea of how the monastery lay, but we were enabled
to do so. Kumbum itself lies at the junction of two small
valleys, one coming from the east, the other from the south,
the buildings lying to the south of the former, while on the
north is the "Precious Hill," which keeps off all evil
influences. On the east side of the other valley are most of
the private dwellings, while on the west are temples, chief
among which is the famous "Gold-Tiled Temple" of Tsong
K'aba. Lower down, below the junction of these two valleys,
is the little town of Lusar. Altogether in Kumbum there
are close on 4,000 priests, the vast majority of which, say
seventy per cent., are Tibetans; of the rest about twenty per
cent. are Mongols, and the remainder Chinese. Nearly all
of them speak Chinese with a greater or less degree of
fluency, but there are a few who speak only Mongol and
Tibetan.
</p>

<p>
It has, I believe, been stated in print, though I have never
seen it, that Kumbum is entirely Chinese in its government
and organisation. That this is not the case needs no further
proof than the fact that, in all things temporal, it is under
the Tsong T'u, or Prince of the Koko Nor, a mandarin
appointed by the Emperor to govern all his Tibetan dependencies<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
in this direction; he lives at Sining, and is known
among Tibetans and Mongols as the "Seling Amban"; on
the other hand, if Kumbum were really Chinese, it would be
subservient to the Fu of Sining, and would be governed by
the Fu T'ai. There is, moreover, a distinct boundary line,
separating the territory which comes under Fu T'ai from
that which comes under the Tsong T'u, those living within
the boundary paying taxes to the monastery, while those
outside pay to Sining Fu.

CHAPTER XXIV.

<p class="ch_summ">
THE STORY OF THE FIRST BUDDHA OF THE EMPIRE—THE SACRED
TREE—THE GOLD-TILED TEMPLE—PARTING FROM MINA
FU-YEH—THE GREEN GLAZED-TILE TEMPLE—THE FLOWER
TEMPLE—SIGNS OF THE MOHAMMEDAN REBELLION—AT THE
MISSION HOUSE.
</p>

<p>
When we got outside Mina Fu-yeh's house, the first thing
that caught our eyes was a row of eight small towers or
chortens, like those one sees in Ladakh, from which, I
believe, Kumbum gets its Chinese name of "T'ah Ri Ssi,"
the "Monastery of the Eight Towers." From these we
crossed by a small bridge to the eastern side of the
valley, where many of the private houses are, and got a good
bird's-eye view of the whole place. Unfortunately it was a
dull, cloudy day, unsuitable for taking photos with a kodak,
so I did not get as many as I should have liked, but while
we were standing looking across the valley, a number of
priests came out from the public reading hall, and I managed
to get a pretty fair picture of them.
</p>

<p>
Principal among the private dwellings is that of A-chia
Fu-yeh, who belongs to Kumbum, and is the first Buddha
of the Empire. The story is, that just before he died, the
Emperor promised him that if, on his return to this world,
he would repeat all the conversations they had had, in his
then lifetime, he would make him the first Buddha in the
Empire. In due time he was reincarnated, and of course
had no difficulty in doing what was required, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
Emperor fulfilled his promise. A-chia Fu-yeh now lives
almost entirely in Pekin, in the presence of the Emperor,
and rarely visits his distant home. A fire broke out in his
house in 1895, which spoilt it a good deal, and it has not
been restored yet.

<p>
All the private houses and temples at Kumbum are
supposed to be whitewashed annually, but, like many other
things, this had been neglected owing to the rebellion. They
were now due two coats of whitewash, and consequently did
not look as clean and bright as they should have done.
The method of whitewashing appears strange to us, for the
custom is to mix the wash, then to ascend to the roof, and
pour it down over the walls. The result is not quite satisfactory,
as we should look at it, but customs like these
cannot be altered.

<p class="caption">KUMBUM.</p>
</div>

<p>
We now recrossed the stream, and began our tour of the
temples. The first place we visited was the kitchen, chiefly
remarkable for its enormous iron cooking-pots. Of these there
were three, fixed in a mud range, each big enough to hold a
man with comfort, and each heated by a large furnace. Everything
was perfectly clean, and one might have eaten one's
food off the floor. From here we went to two small temples
of Sakya Muni, which stand on the right of the "Gold-Tiled
Temple." In them there was nothing peculiar, merely the
ordinary ornaments and lamps, which can be seen in any
temple.
</p>

<p>
Just in this corner, however, is the original "Sacred
Tree,"<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> which sprung, according to some, from Tsong K'aba's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
hair, according to others, from his swaddling-clothes. However
this may be, the main fact remains, that on its leaves
a true believer can distinctly trace the figure of Sakya Muni,
or his name in Tibetan characters. Some priests say that
one thing is to be seen, some the other, but Mina Fu-yeh
says that on some leaves the figure may be seen, on others
the characters; as only firm believers can trace anything,
the question is likely to remain in doubt, in spite of Huc's
assertion that he detected images.
</p>

<p>
We now entered the "Gold-Tiled Temple," the chief
feature of the place, and the pride of Eastern Tibet, the
sacred shrine of Tsong K'aba, the restorer and purifier of
the Buddhist religion. Born in the year 1360 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, he grew
up to find the Buddhism of his day in a very corrupt and
degenerate state; he devoted his life to rectifying this, and
succeeded in re-establishing the old order of things in
accordance with the original doctrines of the faith. He was
the founder of what is known as the "Yellow Sect," who
wore yellow garments in place of red, but nowadays they
have reverted to the red cloak, except on rare occasions,
though they always wear a big yellow hat when reading
the sacred books.
</p>

<p>
Before the entrance to the shrine there were a few lamas
busily kotowing, and the boards in front of the doorway
have been worn away to a depth of three or four inches,
and polished till they shine again by the hands of the
devout, as they knock their heads before the image of the
saint. Most of these lamas knew Mr. Rijnhart, and stopped
a moment or two in their devotions to speak a word of
welcome to us, and one of the door-keepers asked us why
we did not knock our heads before entering? To this
Rijnhart replied that this would be no sign of respect on
our part, as our custom was to remove our hats on entering
a sacred place, nor did we ever omit to do so.
</p>

<p>
On entering the door, the figure of Tsong K'aba, who is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
in a sitting position, is considerably above one, and not
easily seen in the dim, religious light. It is about eight
feet high, I should say, and very richly gilt. Below and in
front of him is the shrine, with the usual holy water vases
and butter lamps, while on either side are handsome gold
and silver lamps, and a fine pair of elephant tusks. We lit
a few lamps, and then walked slowly round the building,
carefully keeping everything on the right hand.
</p>

<p>
Next in interest to the golden image among the relics in
this temple, comes the stone on which Tsong K'aba's mother
sat when delivered of her saintly son. This is carefully kept
just as it was when originally placed in the temple. We
then went upstairs to the second story, where we would be
on a level with the great image; at first, one of the
guardians refused to allow us to ascend, but Rijnhart
assured him that we meant no harm, and that we had
Mina Fu-yeh's permission to go where we would. Somewhat
reluctantly he gave way, but a small douceur on our
departure made him look on foreigners with more favourable
eyes. This story was entirely devoted to Tsong K'aba's
figure, in front of which lamps were burning, while hundreds
of "scarves of blessing" (k'artag) hung all round,
placed there by the hands of the faithful. There was yet
another story, from which we looked down on to the lower
portion of the gilded roof. The priests say that there is
a quarter of an inch of gold all over the roof, but even
deducting a great deal from this, it must be of immense
value, and one could not help wondering how it had escaped
two Mohammedan rebellions in the last thirty years. One
would have thought that they would have risked everything
to secure such loot, and to deal such a blow to the rival
religion as the sacking of this temple would be.
</p>

<p>
From the Gold-Tiled Temple we passed into a big courtyard,
which lies in front of the temple or hall for public
reading. This is merely a large hall, without relics or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
shrines. In the courtyard are two very big prayer wheels,
which one turns with a handle. At each revolution a bell
is rung mechanically, and, after ringing the bell, the turner
is bound to complete another revolution, stopping just
before it rings again.
</p>

<p>
From the public reading-hall we went into that for
private reading—a fine room, with rows of low forms about six
inches high, comfortably cushioned, and big enough to hold
about 2,500 priests. In front of this is another courtyard,
in which, we were told, it is no unusual sight to see 1,200
or 1,500 pairs of shoes, belonging to students inside. How
any one can find his own when he comes out is a mystery.
</p>

<p>
In an upper room in this block of buildings is a collection
of curios and other property belonging to the monastery,
quantities of silver vases, lamps, and musical instruments,
but by far the most interesting thing, and what we were
most anxious to see, is a picture of Tsong K'aba, drawn by
himself in his own blood. When he was at Lhassa he was
anxious to send his mother news of his well-being, so he
drew this picture and sent it to Amdo, where she was living.
The moment it was delivered into her hands the picture
spoke, telling her not to be anxious about her son, for he
was in Lhassa, and in perfect health. This occurred over
400 years ago, but the picture is in wonderful preservation,
and very fresh.
</p>

<p>
There is another interesting figure of one Mété Fu-yeh.
This is made in mud, and, like the picture of Tsong K'aba,
it is under glass. Some time after its completion, by some
miraculous power, hair grew on the head of the saint. He
must have been a holy man, indeed, to have been favoured
with such a manifestation of divine power. Here, as
elsewhere, we gave the caretakers a few cash and lit a few
lamps, small civilities which never failed in securing us
their goodwill, and in return for which they showed us any
attention in their power.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
</p>

<p class="caption">TWO SMALL SHRINES, WITH NUMBERS OF PRAYER WHEELS.</p>
</div>

<p>
As we were leaving this courtyard we met a very refined-looking
and well-dressed priest. He was delighted to see
Rijnhart, and inquired eagerly after his wife, how he liked
living at Tankar, how long was he going to stay in Kumbum,
and many other questions. This man and his elder brother
are two of the richest priests in the monastery; the latter
has bought the title of K'ombo, which ensures his returning
as a Buddha in his next lifetime, a distinction which,
according to Mina Fu-yeh, is also in store for Mr. Rijnhart,
as a reward for the good work he is now doing according
to his lights. We now walked round the outside of the
monastery, going up the hill at the back and descending
on the other side close to the village of Lusar. On the
way we passed two small shrines, chiefly remarkable for
the number of prayer wheels or cylinders ranged outside
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
them. All these we carefully set in motion, and then went
on our way, feeling that the day had not been wasted.
Round the outskirts were a few prayer stones like one sees
in Ladakh, but they were nothing like so plentiful nor of
such good workmanship as they are about Leh. It is a
form of devotion which does not seem to have found great
favour in Eastern Tibet. The next hour was pleasantly
spent in the village buying curios, such as the yellow head
dresses previously mentioned, Buddhist bells, and suchlike
mementos of our visit; but there were two more small
temples to be seen, food to be eaten, and a ride of fifty li to
be made to Sining before sunset, so we could not afford to
spend much time shopping.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the house we were stopping in, we gave
orders for the horses to be fed and to be got ready to start
as soon as we had had our midday meal. While this was
being prepared we again went and sat with our host, who
produced a small atlas given him by Rijnhart, on which we
showed him our route, the road to India viâ Lhassa and
Darjeeling, and the way to England by the Suez Canal.
At present he is very full of a plan to accompany Rijnhart
next time he goes home, and very likely to go on to
America. Rijnhart has taught him the English names of
many countries, and he took the greatest pride in pointing
these out and repeating their names. But he has learnt a
great deal more of Europeans than mere parrot-like repetition
of a few names. In the course of conversation he has
picked up a lot of our doctrines, and discusses them freely
with Rijnhart, comparing them with his own, and expressing
the profoundest admiration for the great Central Figure,
which is to us what Tsong K'aba is to him, the ideal to live up
to. In his own way he reconciles the two religions, saying
that Tsong K'aba must have been a later incarnation of Jesus
Christ, and that in reality he worships the same divinity
that we do, but in a different way and with different details.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
Before we left Mina Fu-yeh gave us each a photograph of
himself, which had been taken and printed for him by
Rijnhart; in return we promised to send ours, and when
we asked if there was anything else he would like, he said,
"Flower seeds! the queerer the shape and stranger the
colour the better." These of course we promised. I hope
he will be pleased when he gets them if he is still at Kumbum,
for he was then thinking of making a journey either to the
Eastern Mongols again or to Lhassa.<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> If only he could
be persuaded to allow one to accompany him to the latter
place what a chance it would be.
</p>

<p>
Food being now ready, we ate it as quickly as might be,
for it was already close on two o'clock. It was no easy
thing to get away, for, with true Tibetan hospitality, our
host and his little disciple joined in pressing us to eat, the
latter saying to Rijnhart with a great show of displeasure,
"I know that when you're at home you always eat five
basins of food, and here you only eat two." At last we
were ready to start. Nothing delayed us except that a priest
who had gone to get us a supply of sacred leaves had not yet
returned; in a few moments he ran up with about a hundred
of them, and received a suitable present in return. Mina
Fu-yeh warned us never to put anything on top of them as
they were very precious, and to do so would be sacrilege. He
also assured us that they had wonderful medicinal powers,
and that if ever we were ill we had only to make use of them
and a prompt cure would result. Last good-byes were said,
and then we left the house full of regrets that we had had
to cut our stay so short.
</p>

<p>
There were still the two small temples to visit; they both
lie close together, below the entrance to the big temples.
The first of the two was called the Green Glazed-Tile Temple,
to distinguish it from the others. One enters it by a gateway
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
underneath a stone arch. In front of the gateway about the
centre of the courtyard is a large stone to which some cash
were sticking.<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> Behind this are the two other sacred trees
which have sprung from the original one mentioned above;
unfortunately there was no caretaker in this temple when we
went in, so we could not discover the history of this stone nor
any reason for the cash being put there. However, not to leave
anything undone, we left our own contribution with the rest.
</p>

<p>
Inside the temple is a large figure of Sakya Muni, and
on either side of him, lining the walls to the right and left,
are figures of the first eighteen missionaries to China, who
carried the word from India to the Far East. It seems
strange, looking at these figures, and thinking of those other
devout Chinese pilgrims, who made the long journey to India,
to try and get the original scriptures to take back to their
native land, that Buddhism should have so totally disappeared
from India, while flourishing in the country of its adoption.
</p>

<p>
We had now come to the last temple on the list, the
Flower Temple, or Hua Miao. The courtyard of this
temple was empty, but all round the walls are painted
frescoes of horrible tortures. Inside there are a number
of stuffed animals, terrible caricatures, many of them quite
as grotesque as the tortured figures oil the walls outside.
Among them is a large tiger, which is always kept saddled
and bridled, ready for the Spiritual Buddha to ride upon at
any moment; it is occasionally used in ceremonies, the
abbot of the monastery seating himself upon it.
</p>

<p>
During the recent rebellion, all arms destined to be used
against the Mohammedans, either in defence of the monastery
or otherwise, were brought to be blessed in this temple,
and hither all men going out to fight brought their offerings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Our flying visit to Kumbum and its temples was now at
an end, and the feeling uppermost in our minds was, without
doubt, regret we could not afford to stay at least two
or three days longer. We had seen a lot, but only enough
to make us feel how much more there was to see and learn.
The true Buddhist religion is one of deep interest, especially
in these days of Theosophy and similar cults, and a man
like Mina Fu-yeh, who is not only thoroughly well versed
in all its tenets and scriptures, but is also sufficiently liberal
minded to converse about them, is rare indeed.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">PRAYER WHEELS, BOARDS, ROSARY FROM LUSAR.</p>
</div>

<p>
Regrets, however, were vain. We had not a day to spare,
and it was imperative that we should push on as rapidly as
possible. So we made the best of it, and congratulated ourselves
upon having seen as much as we had; for there is no
gainsaying the fact, that, but for the friendly terms Rijnhart
was on with the Buddhas and lamas of the place, we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
should never have gained entrance to the monastery, and
by ourselves we should have seen nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was already late, and as the gates of every Chinese
town are closed at sunset, we had to shove our animals
along pretty smartly to get into Sining in time. From
Lusar the road lies over an easy pass into the "Southern
Valley," which it follows right up to the western gate of
the town. On the way we passed a small temple of
P'an Ku, who was, according to Chinese mythology, the
only man on the sun. He knocked off bits which formed
the moon, the stars and the planets, and then jumped off
on to the earth, where his hair became grass, and his other
features became corresponding ones on the earth's surface.
</p>

<p>
After riding hard for about fifteen li, we stopped at one
of the little inns by the roadside, to refresh ourselves with
bread and tea. As we proceeded we passed several water
mills, and entered one for curiosity's sake. The mill was
built over a stream, whose water was made to flow along a
trough, thence on to the spokes of a wheel, which in consequence
revolved. To the axis of this wheel a stout pole was
fixed, which, penetrating the floor of the mill, supported a
round, flat stone, which revolved also. Over this was another
flat, round stone, hanging from the roof, through a hole in
which grain was allowed to fall on to the lower stone, and thus
be crushed. This particular mill was crushing mustard seed.
</p>

<p>
All the way to Sining signs of the rebellion were plentiful,
just as they had been on the way from Tankar. The whole
countryside had been devastated by the Mohammedans
while they had had the upper hand, but at the city gate, which
we passed through just at 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the boot was on the other
leg, for there, hanging in cages on the wall, were the heads
of the ringleaders, who had been caught and executed by
the orders of the Government, as soon as the soldiers had
defeated the rebels. Among these heads was that of the
Tibetan who had killed the French traveller, De Trouille
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
De Rhins, about two years previously. As we entered the
city some soldiers passed out. Rijnhart told us, later on,
that they called us "foreign devils," but as we did not
understand a word of Chinese, we rode on in blissful
ignorance of the insult.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes more riding brought us to the mission
house, where we were most hospitably received by Mr. and
Mrs. Ridley, and Mr. Hall, of the China Inland Mission,
who have been working nobly for some years in this out-of-the-way
corner of the globe.
</p>

<p>
I am afraid that the good missionaries at Sining were
somewhat taken aback at our turning up on Sunday evening,
but this in no wise detracted from the hospitality of our
reception. I must frankly admit that both Malcolm and I
had quite lost count of days of the week for months one
day had been so like another. We were, therefore, quite
ignorant of the fact that it was Sunday, till Mrs. Ridley
happened to mention it.
</p>

<p>
Introductions were soon over, and we were taken into
a most comfortably furnished drawing-room, the home-like
appearance of which was greatly enhanced by an English
stove. After washing our hands we went in to tea; we
were hungry after our ride, and some first-rate home-made
cakes proved altogether too great a temptation for us. I
don't think either of us ever ate so much cake before, and
I don't suppose we ever shall again.
</p>

<p>
In the course of conversation Hall told us that he had
arranged for mules to start for Lancheo with our baggage
the following day, but that it might be two or three days
before we, ourselves, would be able to get on. This, however,
did not much matter, as, by travelling fast, we should
easily be able to overtake it.
</p>

<p>
We sat up late that night listening to Ridley's account of
their experiences during the rebellion, and we were able to
form some idea of the trying time they had passed through.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXV.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ20">
THE MOHAMMEDAN REBELLION IN CHINA, 1895–6.
</p>

<p>
While all Europe was busily engaged watching the progress
of the war between China and Japan, and speculating
as to what its ultimate result would be, the Province of
Kansu was passing through a time of war and murder, fire
and pillage, such as has rarely been known, and the severity
of which can scarcely be realized, except by those who have
visited the scene of it.
</p>

<p>
So scanty were the reports which appeared in the English
or Indian papers, that Malcolm and I were little prepared
for the scenes of devastation we passed through, or for the
stories we heard from the missionaries, who spoke only
from their own experiences.
</p>

<p>
The first signs of disturbance occurred in March, 1895,
arising out of a quarrel between the two sects of Mohammedans—the
"Salars" or "white-capped" sect, and the
"black-capped" Mohammedans. The former came into
China about 400 years ago. They are far more devout and
far more fanatical than the "black caps," and to this day
they preserve very many traces of their western origin.
They live in eighteen villages, or "kung," on the south side
of the Yellow River, and number nearly 20,000 souls.
</p>

<p>
The Tao T'ai of Sining, a high district official, went to
Hsiun-Hua-Ting, about eighty miles from Sining, the scene
of the disturbance, with a view to inquiring into and
settling it. In a moment of indiscretion he seized and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
put to death an important Salar chief; this was the signal
for an outbreak. The Salars rose <i>en masse</i>, the Tao T'ai
was imprisoned, and the rebellion, which was to last for
more than a year, had begun. Towards the end of March
a body of soldiers, under a Major Uang, was treacherously
attacked by Salars; twenty-four were killed and many
wounded.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of this attack was a proclamation by the
governor-general of the province of Kansu, to the effect
that all Salars were to be killed without mercy. This was
a hasty and ill-advised step, as its immediate result was
to cause great excitement and disaffection among all
Mohammedans of both sects—a very serious matter—comprising
as they did about one quarter of the whole
population of the province, while in wealth and enterprise
they represented an even larger proportion. A second proclamation
to the effect that there were good and bad Salars,
and that only the latter were to be destroyed, did nothing
to allay the feeling of uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
During April people from the villages crowded into
Sining, bringing in what grain and family belongings
they could carry. Meanwhile all available soldiers from
Lancheo, the capital of the province, Liang-Cheo, and other
towns to the east, were sent up to Sining; but they were
sadly insufficient to cope with the work there was before
them. A reward of Ts.10 for every living Salar, and Ts.5
for every dead one was offered, and Tibetan soldiers were
induced to help the Chinese by promises of Salar territory.
</p>

<p>
By the end of April three Salar villages had been taken,
but the Tao T'ai was still a prisoner, and the rising was
undoubtedly on the increase. Luckily for Kansu, there
was one man in Sining at this time who was thoroughly
able to cope with the difficulties which arose. This was
General Teng, the general in command at Sining.
Throughout the rebellion he behaved in a truly heroic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
manner, and succeeded in winning the entire confidence
and affection of the people, a bright contrast to most
Chinese officials, whose only idea is self. He was also an
able commander; his troops followed him as they followed
no one else, with the natural result that when led by him
they were almost invariably victorious.
</p>

<p>
General Teng left Sining for the disturbed district about
the end of April, and was absent about two months, defeating
the rebels in two battles, and taking the city of Hsiun-Hua-Ting.
Soon after his return, however, disquieting rumours
were heard of further risings at Ho-Cheo and other places.
</p>

<p>
Ho-Cheo is the principal Mohammedan city in Kansu.
Their chief colleges are there, and it is one of the few
places where Arabic is well known. An outbreak there was
almost certain to ensure the rebellion becoming general,
and no longer remaining confined to the "white-capped"
sect.
</p>

<p>
Since the last rebellion, which ended some twenty-three
years ago, no Mohammedans have been allowed to reside
inside the cities, but have been compelled to reside in the
suburbs, and seeing that in 1895 nearly every town of
importance in Kansu had a Mohammedan suburb, the
seriousness of a general outbreak can be imagined.
</p>

<p>
On the 11th July, General Teng again left Sining for
the seat of war, and in a very few days he inflicted a
severe defeat on the rebels, killing 700, with but slight
loss to his own side; but the tide of rebellion was now too
strong to be checked, and the death of a few hundreds
made no appreciable difference. Sining was gradually
being closed in, and was now almost shut off from the seat
of war. To add to the trouble, a rumour got about that
10,000 Mohammedans in the east suburb of Sining itself
were on the eve of rebelling, a danger which would be
rendered even more serious by the absence of the general
with every available soldier from the garrison.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of July the enemy gradually closed in
on the city, burning villages, and murdering men, women,
and children; in Sin-Tien-Pu, a city to the west, about 2,000
people were killed. To-Pa, a walled town, was able to hold
its own, but in most places the inhabitants were powerless
to defend themselves, greatly owing to want of able and
determined leaders. Sining itself was little better, but
happily for all within the walls General Teng suddenly
returned.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after his arrival it became known that certain
influential people in the city had made a plot, which would,
they hoped, result in his degradation, thereby removing
the greatest obstacle in the way of Mohammedan success.
A certain gentleman of the name of Chu, backed up by
three other men of position, had drawn up a petition, which
he had presented to the Taitai general, with a request that
it might be forwarded to Lancheo. The petition was to the
effect that after his last big fight, General Teng had ruthlessly
butchered 700 harmless individuals, and that he
ought to be disgraced. It seems incredible that even
Chinamen could be so lost to any sense of patriotism, that
they could accept Mohammedan silver as a reward for
bringing about the downfall of the one man on whom the
safety of their fellow-countrymen depended. The news of
this plot soon spread among the people, and retribution
swiftly followed. Mr. Chu was caught in the streets, and
paid the penalty for his treachery with his life, while his
three colleagues narrowly escaped. Their houses were
wrecked, and every stick of property was destroyed by the
infuriated mob.
</p>

<p>
The villages in the immediate vicinity of Sining were the
next to suffer, and on the 26th July a large number of wounded
people, mostly women and children, arrived in the city.
The Temple of the God of Literature was turned into a
temporary hospital, and the missionaries were begged to go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
and see what they could do for the sufferers. Needless to
say, they lost not a moment in answering this appeal, and
from that time on their hands were full, from early
morning to late at night.
</p>

<p>
How some of the wounded ever managed to struggle as
far as the city is more than the missionaries could tell us.
One old woman, sixty-four years of age, had fourteen lance
thrusts and a sword cut on her body, while a six-months-old
child had three sword cuts on its face alone, and yet
both these and many others in similar cases had travelled
a distance of seventeen English miles before they could get
any aid. So badly wounded were some of them, that they
had taken three and four days on the road, and yet they
had lived through it all.
</p>

<p>
All August the enemy ravaged the country, burning and
pillaging, and a few small engagements took place. On
the 16th August two rebels were caught and brought into
the city. They said that there were 9,000 rebels in the
valley to the north of Sining, that they were going to block
the road from Lancheo, under Han-Uen-Sheo, the chief
insurrectionary leader, and that Sining itself was to be
surrounded on the 15th of the seventh moon—<i>i.e.</i>, on
the 3rd September.
</p>

<p>
A curious story came in about this time from Sin Ch'eng,
whether true or not I cannot say; but the story goes that
the rebels had succeeded in cutting the people off from the
river, their only water supply. Death stared them in the
face, for to surrender meant death without mercy; but
Providence was on their side, for the rats in the town had
worked a way to the river bed, and through this the water
trickled into the city, slowly at first, but gradually increasing
in volume until the supply was sufficient for man and
beast.
</p>

<p>
At last the event which had been feared so long occurred;
the rebels in the east suburb of Sining broke out on the 1st
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
September, and the inhabitants had to make up their minds to
withstand a prolonged siege with all its attendant horrors.
Several times the general had applied to Lancheo for reinforcements,
but had been met with the reply that these
Mohammedans were good people, and that there was no
fear of their not remaining loyal. The Tao T'ai had also
been of the same opinion, or said he was, with the result
that they now had to pay dearly for their undue confidence.
On the news of this fresh outbreak the city was thrown
into a state of wild confusion. Common people and soldiers
rushed promiscuously on to the walls, while those
on guard hastened to the city gate. In the suburb the
Mohammedans set fire to all the Chinese houses, and piled
up furniture in the streets to act as a protection against
an attack from the city, while above all the noise and
confusion was the firing of guns and cannon from the
city walls.
</p>

<p>
The 3rd September was a day of heavy fighting; a number
of rebels came down from the north valley, and the men of
the garrison went out to meet them. Fighting went on all
day, decidedly in favour of the Chinese; but late in the day
an attack on the suburb, made through a mistaken order,
ended most disastrously, so that what should have been
a very successful day ended as the reverse. Han-Uen-Sheo
himself arrived in the suburb a few days later. Prices
began to rise in Sining, oil being sold at three times its
usual cost. Distrust of the officials was again excited by
a statement being made that the Tao T'ai had received
Ts.5,000 from the Mohammedans to promise that their
submission would be accepted, should they wish it. This
report was undoubtedly believed by many of the people,
though on what grounds is hard to say.
</p>

<p>
The 21st September was another day of hard fighting,
ending in favour of the Chinese, although the enemy managed
to fire some temples and grain outside the city. The Chinese
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
had a great advantage in arms, the horse soldiers being
armed with European rifles, while the infantry and Tibetans
all had guns of native manufacture; the rebels, on the other
hand, having very few of any kind. Seventy of them were
killed or wounded in this day's fighting.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of this month the garrison was increased
by 130 soldiers and 300 faithful Salars and Tibetans, a
welcome addition, as they are both far bolder men than the
average Chinaman. About the middle of October news
reached the besieged city that eleven battalions had reached
Ping-Chong-i, about sixty li only from Sining, but that the
rebels were holding the narrow gorges of Siao Hsia in force,
and blocking their further progress.
</p>

<p>
In one engagement, some rebels, disguised as Chinese
soldiers, met these relieving battalions on the march. The
latter took the rebels for troops from Sining, and were
preparing to greet them, when suddenly the disguise was
thrown off, and the Chinese, being caught at a disadvantage,
suffered severely, over a hundred of them being killed, and
a number of rifles with a large amount of ammunition being
lost. Every day the Mohammedans gave proofs of their
individual courage, showing that had they been anything
like as well armed as the Chinese, they would in all
probability have got into Sining.
</p>

<p>
In the same way another month passed, the wretched
inhabitants of Sining anxiously awaiting news and relief
from the east, while every few days fighting took place
outside the walls. Diphtheria added to the trials of the
defenders, and the missionaries were all more or less worn
out with their labours. One can scarcely picture to oneself
the horror of Mrs. Ridley's position at this time. She, the
only white lady in the city, had to face the daily uncertainty
as to whether the enemy would succeed in getting in or
not, and the possibility (always present in China) of
the populace turning against her as well, actuated by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
the wild idea that their troubles were all caused by the
"foreign devils" in their midst.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of November, a fresh rumour arrived to the
effect that reinforcements had not yet reached Lancheo,
but the resulting disappointment was somewhat alleviated
by the arrival of two men who had been sent down to
Niempe, a walled town, 120 li from Sining, to try and find
out the truth about a supply of guns and ammunition reported
to have arrived there. These men each brought back
a specimen of the rifles, which proved to be Remingtons,
and which so delighted the General that he sent off eighty
men through the hills to bring back as many rifles and as
much ammunition as they could manage. These men got
safely through, and returned a week later with a number
of Remingtons and some French repeating rifles and
ammunition.
</p>

<p>
On the 30th November, the news arrived of another
fight at Ping-Chong-i, resulting in a decisive victory for the
rebels, who captured all the arms from the Chinese troops.
A few days later 200 people were killed in the south valley,
and rumours of relief were very conflicting. At one time
the reliefs were expected in a few days, at another they had
not yet left Lancheo; but at last what seemed to be reliable
information was received that thirteen battalions of veteran
soldiers had arrived at Ping Fang, 120 miles from Sining.
</p>

<p>
A day or two afterwards the besieged were further
encouraged by the safe arrival of a large convoy with
oil, grain, and other useful articles, including a large
quantity of pipe-lighters.
</p>

<p>
Every one was greatly delighted, especially at the news
of the reinforcement, coming, as it did, so close on the news
of the defeat at Ping-Chong-i, and when all hope of relief
for some time had apparently vanished. The escort with the
convoy got into the city unmolested, but about a thousand
men belonging to it made two unsuccessful attempts to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
leave, being driven back on both occasions. But the end
was soon to come now, and the rebels seemed to have heard
the news of the large bodies of men coming up to the relief
of the beleaguered city, for numbers of them began to offer
their submission, which, needless to say, was not accepted,
partly through mistrust, and partly from a desire on the
part of the Chinese to avenge the deaths of those who had
fallen, and the destruction of their property.
</p>

<p>
On the 2nd of January, 1896, about twelve horse soldiers
arrived and demanded admission to the city, saying that
they had come from Lancheo, that General Li, Commander-in-Chief
of the Kansu forces, was a few miles behind, and
that a Colonel T'ang, from Lancheo, was also following.
However, they had no official documents, and admission
was refused until the Commander-in-Chief himself should
arrive. Meanwhile the excitement in the city at the prospect
of the siege shortly coming to an end was intense, an
excitement which was increased by the non-arrival of the
Commander-in-Chief, and by a very large body of men,
apparently soldiers, being seen to pass into the rebel
quarters in the suburb. Next day the excitement increased,
if possible. Colonel T'ang arrived, and was admitted; but
it was reported that General Li was afraid to come into the
city, lest the people should attack him. However, the next
day he arrived, the rebels apparently making no efforts to
prevent his entry.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the Commander-in-Chief had been received
officially by the city dignitaries, he was intercepted by a
deputation of the gentry, who presented him with a memorandum
they had prepared, showing the places which had
been destroyed, and a list of the 40,000 people slain. The
General then explained that the rebels had submitted to
him at Ping-Chong-i, and that through want of ammunition,
and having already suffered two defeats, he had been compelled
to accept their submission, instead of being able to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
punish them.<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> The procession then wound its way to the
principal yamen. The streets were crowded with people,
all begging and beseeching the Commander-in-Chief on no
account to make terms with the enemy, but to avenge the
deaths of those they had lost. This must have been a most
affecting sight, especially when one remembers that there can
have been few, if any, in all that crowd, who had not lost a
husband, a wife, a brother, a sister, or some other near relative,
in those terrible months of civil war. But there were
not yet sufficient troops in Sining to enable the Chinese
to take the offensive.
</p>

<p>
On the 7th of January the first news of the outer world
since the 24th of July reached the missionaries in Sining, as
a small party of soldiers brought them up a quantity of letters
from Lancheo. All danger was now at an end; there were
plenty of troops near at hand, and communication with the
east had been established. The final relief was effected on
the 14th of the same month, when the first batch of troops,
2,000 in number, arrived amid general rejoicing, especially
as their leader was General Ho, a native of the district, in
whom the people had far greater confidence than they had
in the Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
The work of retribution now began. The submission
accepted by Commander-in-Chief Li was set aside, and the
Chinese gave full play to their lust for vengeance. First the
south suburb was absolutely wrecked, the rebels' houses were
gutted, and their mosque razed to the ground. About thirty
of them who were hiding in cupboards and other places were
promptly killed. Some notices were put up in the city the
same evening, saying that, as the people had submitted to
the Commander-in-Chief their property was to be respected.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
The only answer from the infuriated mob was to tear down
the notices, smash up the notice boards, and drag the
responsible officials from their houses into the streets,
where they were mercilessly beaten, and but for the prompt
action of General Teng, to whom alone the people looked
for orders, they would certainly have been killed. Had the
Commander-in-Chief been in the city at the time he would
have fared no better, and possibly worse.
</p>

<p>
For the next month Generals Ho and Teng were occupied
driving the rebels out of the villages and strongholds they
had captured, and restoring order in the district, the
method employed being the somewhat drastic one of putting
to death without question every Mohammedan who
fell into their hands; thus at Shen-Chong, a village twenty
miles up the south valley, 600 to 700 were slaughtered,
while many set fire to their houses and were burnt to death.
</p>

<p>
This cleared the south valley and opened the road to
T'ah-rï-sï, where the festival of the Chinese New Year was
held as usual, on the 12th February. The north valley
and the east suburb still had to be dealt with.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th February a number of Chinese went up the
north valley to worship at the graves of their ancestors,
some soldiers having preceded them the day before. While
engaged in their devotions, and thinking little of danger,
200 rebels wearing Chinese uniforms suddenly swept down
upon them from the west, and finding them defenceless, cut
them down right and left; fortunately, some cavalry from
the city came to the rescue promptly and so saved many
lives, but fifty had already been killed and numbers
wounded. One boy was brought into Sining with twenty-four
wounds, another with seventeen, and a third with
sixteen. How these ever recovered is a marvel, but recover
they did, thanks to the missionaries. Can one wonder
after this that the Chinese soldiers refused to spare any,
even when ordered to do so by their officers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Village after village now fell into the hands of the two
generals, who, on the 19th February, were reinforced by
ten battalions (5000 men) from the south, under General
Uei-Kuang-Tao, commander-in-chief of the Hunan troops.
These troops were quartered in the east suburb, and on
their arrival Commander-in-Chief Li took the earliest
opportunity to leave a city where he was so cordially disliked,
and where his safety was very doubtful. With a
view to getting away, he summoned those leaders who had
tendered their submission at Ping Chong Island, handed
them and their affairs over to General Teng, and left for
Lancheo with thirty or forty followers.
</p>

<p>
Commander-in-Chief Li's departure was the signal for a
general slaughter to commence, and the quicker we pass
over this painful subject the better. Suffice it to say that the
name of every rebel of any importance was extracted from
these leaders, those in the suburb were called out, any
refusing to come were killed on the spot, and the remainder
murdered after a semblance of a trial; the only thing we
can say is that torture, so common a feature of Chinese
justice, was never resorted to—retribution was sure and
swift. For many days this continued, as rebels were brought
in from the villages to be dealt with in the city, the heads
of important men being hung up in cages just inside the
west gate.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Hunan soldiers under General Uei were
not distinguishing themselves; they were worsted in nearly
every engagement, and Generals Ho and Teng constantly
had to come to their assistance. One little incident rather
tended to dim their fame in the eyes of those who had been
so long besieged. Eight battalions went to retake a small
village called Su-kia-pu. For four days they bombarded it
steadily without a shot being fired in reply, but fearing
some deep-laid plot, they dared not attempt an assault;
on the fourth day General Ho came to their assistance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
Encouraged by these reinforcements, the Hunan troops
rushed to take the stronghold by storm. They had just
got to the gate when they were met by an old woman, who
meekly inquired why they had been firing so long, for
besides herself there were only two old women in the
village; she herself was lame and the other two blind, for
which reasons they had stayed when every one else had
run away.
</p>

<p>
By the middle of March the last places in the north
valley had been relieved, but the rebels still held the
fortress of To-Pa, the honour of reducing which was left
to General Uei, a task he and his soldiers (15,000) proved
quite unable to accomplish. He was at length superseded
by General Teng, who was ordered back to Sining from the
district where he had been very successful. His return
was followed by many of the worst of the rebels leaving the
country, and by the fall of To-Pa, when the execution of
ringleaders was recommenced, and went on without cessation
for many days, about sixteen being brought in daily for
justice.
</p>

<p>
After this, there was one more outbreak in the south-east;
about 400 rebels were killed in a fight, the Chinese losing
about a hundred. This was on the 10th of June, some fifteen
months after the disturbance at Hsiun-Hua-Ting, and was
the last of the regular fighting that occurred.
</p>

<p>
Law and order was gradually restored; business became
brisk, but for a long time disease, especially diphtheria, was
rampant, and the stench in the streets was appalling.
By the time we passed through Sining, towards the end of
October, all signs of the rebellion had passed away from
within the city walls, but outside was ample testimony to
the severity of the struggle, nor could it be otherwise when
one reflects that 10,000 rebels were reported to have fled
to the north-west, 10,000 more, chiefly old men, women,
and children, to have died of cold and starvation on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
mountains, and 18,000, almost entirely women and children,
to have submitted. Excepting the 10,000 who got away to
the north-west, all the able-bodied young men had been
simply wiped out.
</p>

<p>
Such bloody disturbances affected the homes of other
people as well, for the rebels who fled north-west over the
districts in the neighbourhood of the Koko Nor, spread a
feeling of the greatest consternation amongst the inhabitants
through whose land they passed. The Mohammedans
were fleeing for their lives, and being without the necessaries
of life hesitated at no deeds of plunder whenever a chance
occurred. On the other hand, the poor Mongols, being of
a more peaceful nature, and possessing but inferior arms,
had no resource left but abandoning their homes to seek
safety in flight until the hungry wave had rolled on.
</p>

<p>
These cruel acts of devastation naturally caused some
anxiety to the Chinese officials residing in Chinese Turkistan,
so much so, that they deemed it expedient to make appeals
to the Russians for help in case it might be required. It
must not be lost sight of that the Mohammedans of Chinese
Turkistan might have become contaminated and followed
the example of their co-religionists in the east. Had that
been the case, the results might have been extremely serious.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the rebellion had been completely quelled,
there remained in the recently disturbed districts thousands
of idle soldiers who had received their arms for the occasion.
These men, although they had been marched up
from Shantong and other provinces, were disbanded in
Kansu, many hundreds of miles away from their homes,
and, having spent all the pay they had received, they started
a system of highway robbery, and in other ways became a
source of danger to all. This was to some extent carried
on with impunity, as there was a scarcity of men of the
district, for in addition to the 40,000 Chinese who had
been slain, there were some 5,000 more who had died from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
diseases contracted through the overcrowding and filthiness
of the streets.
</p>

<p>
Before the soldiers had squandered their money, trade,
in spite of the high prices demanded, was brisk.
</p>

<p>
The difference in the prices of food before and after the
rebellion, will give some idea of the privations undergone
by the poorer classes, more especially by the women and
children:—

<p>
Another unaccountable calamity befell these unfortunate
people, in the shape of the sudden appearance of a mighty
army of mice, which, just at the time when the grain was
ready for reaping, devoured up the entire crops in the north
and west valleys. From whence they sprung, or whither
they disappeared, nobody knew. After such misfortunes,
it is hard to realize how the people managed to exist
at all.
</p>

<p>
It was rumoured that the Emperor had sent money to
help them, but even if it reached them, it would have been
useless in a place where there was no food to buy. All the
grain captured from the rebels had been expended in feeding
the soldiers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It would appear that the severe and cruel treatment by
both soldiers and the people displayed on the Mohammedans
who remained, and the massacre of many hundreds of
others who had submitted, notably at To-Pa, their chief
stronghold, would merely have the effect of sowing the
seeds of a future and more disastrous rebellion.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that the hatred between the Mohammedans
and Chinese is more intense than ever. There
are, I believe, still some thirty or forty thousand Mohammedans
left in the north and south-east valleys. Were
these to rise, there is the still more serious possibility
of the Government Mohammedan soldiers casting in their
lot with them. Were such a coalition to take place, very
grievous trouble would be caused, and the north-west
provinces would, before very long, be in the hands of the
rebels.
</p>

<p>
It would be wise for the Chinese Government to enquire
into the cause of the last rebellion, and by that means discover
a remedy to prevent another one. Like the majority
of wars, the cause was a religious one. It was, I am told,
merely due to the interference of a Chinese official in a
religious squabble between two Mohammedan sects called the
white and black caps.
</p>

<p>
The judgment finally given was considered to be a one-sided
decision, and ignited the first spark of the rebellion.
Had the difference that had arisen between these two
fanatical sects been entrusted to the arbitration of a few
Mohammedan representatives chosen from each party, an
amicable understanding might have been arrived at.
</p>

<p>
The hatred between the Chinese and the Mohammedans
is so deeply rooted, that even if an impartial judgment is
given, the Mohammedans, whose minds are so prejudiced,
will scarcely credit the truth. There have been for years,
and certainly will be for many more, internal squabbles in
the homesteads and villages of the two sects, and, as long as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
these are judged by Chinese officials, there will always be
the chance of another outbreak.
</p>

<p>
It seems remarkable that, although there have been two
previous outbreaks during the present century, the last
coming to an end only twenty years ago, no adequate
means are taken to remove either the cause of another
rebellion, or to cope with one which has risen.
</p>

<p>
First, the cause might be avoided by the appointment
of certain Mohammedan officials, elected from amongst
those who had remained loyal during the last rebellion, to
manage all their internal affairs, and more especially those
of a religious nature. Unless something of this kind is
attempted it is utterly impossible for these two peoples,
differing so vastly in their character and religious ideas, to
live in harmony for any length of time. Secondly, the
coping with the insurgents could more easily and speedily
be accomplished, were powerful garrisons maintained at
Ho Cheo and Lancheo, and other cities of importance and
Mohammedan centres, properly trained, equipped, and kept
in this state by efficient officers, existing in reality instead
of merely on paper.
</p>

<p>
It seems incredible that the Chinese Government, with
their previous experience, and their knowledge of the
restless and fanatical dispositions of the Mohammedans,
more especially of the black caps or Salar sect, and well
aware of their greater enterprise and energy besides, should
have been powerless at the time of the outbreak. The
rebellion, in consequence, spread at an alarming rate, not to
be suppressed before many thousands of men, women, and
children had been killed or massacred. Even then the
penalty was scarcely paid, for years of starvation and
misery were lying in store for those who had escaped
the calamity.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVI
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
PARTING FROM LOBSAN—STARTING FOR LANCHEO—A RUINED
SUBURB—GOOD DONE BY MISSIONARIES—WE TAKE LEAVE
OF MR. RIDLEY—OUR FIRST CHINESE INN.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, the 19th of October, was decidedly a busy
one; our throng of friends had to be settled up with, and our
fresh mules had to be started off for Lancheo. In China,
when travelling with pack mules, one's baggage is first tied
on to arched wooden frames, which, when everything is
ready, are simply lifted up and placed across the saddle,
and, if necessary, a man can ride on top of his baggage.
This is an excellent arrangement, as the mules are never
kept standing with their loads on, and, on arriving at one's
inn at the end of a day's journey, the frames are simply
lifted off the saddles and carried, just as they are, straight
into one's room. Those things that are required can then
be undone, while the remainder are ready for loading again
the following morning; the only drawback is that, as the
frames ride entirely by balance, great care must be taken
in making up the loads.
</p>

<p>
The weights these mules carried came rather as a revelation
to us, the regulation being 240 Chinese pounds, which
is equivalent to 320 English pounds, and if a man is to
ride his weight is always reckoned as one hundred Chinese
pounds. In India some of the mountain-battery mules carry
loads as heavy, or even heavier, than these, but they are as
a rule far bigger mules, and are much better looked after;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
moreover they are very rarely, if ever, called upon to do the
marches that a mule does in China, where the average stage
is ninety li, or thirty miles, a day.
</p>

<p>
About 11 o'clock the baggage started in charge of our
Duffadar, who also took Esau and Shukr Ali with him, to
assist in looking after the muleteers; although neither of
these men knew a word of Chinese, we had no more anxiety in
sending them off by themselves in the province of Kansu, than
we should have had in India; in many parts of the country
it might have been a somewhat risky proceeding, but away
in the north-west corner of the empire, the people are so
much in the habit of mixing with Tibetans, Mongols, and
others, that they take comparatively little notice of foreigners.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Mongols had been getting the balance of
pay due to them, and, as they had done us good service, we
gave them some extra baksheesh, or "wine-money," as they
call it, and also the old pony we had bought from the
Tibetan merchant. This put them all in high good humour;
they said that if we ever again came to their country they
hoped that we would employ them, Lobsan adding that his
real name, by which he could always be found, was "Dsun
Choni Lama,"<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> by this he was known to everybody, whereas
Lobsan was only his nickname. As soon as they had got
their pay they went off into the town, where, I have no
doubt, they were very soon relieved of the greater part of it
by the wily Chinese.
</p>

<p>
Our business indoors was now finished and we were able
to accompany Ridley round the town. First of all we went
to see about hiring animals to take us to Lancheo, but the
replies we received were not encouraging. We were told that
there were a large number of soldiers leaving Sining, and
that it was very hard to procure carriage of any sort, in
fact, although quite civil, the officials, who could have helped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
us had they wanted to, made it clear that they scarcely
thought it worth while doing so; they contented themselves
with taking a copy of our passport, a very lengthy and
somewhat useless proceeding.
</p>

<p>
Another obstacle in the way of our departure was that
the official intimation of our having left Tankar had not
arrived, for it is the custom, whenever travellers of importance
leave a Chinese town, with carriage supplied by the
yamen, for intimation to be sent to the next place on their
route, where this carriage will have to be changed. In the
present case notice had certainly been sent off from Tankar,
but had not reached Sining, at least, so we were told. After
leaving the yamen we wended our way through the city
towards the eastern suburb, meeting on our way numbers
of mounted soldiers. They had escorted a high military
official, who had left Sining that morning, and were now
returning to the city. A very motley crew they were,
mounted on miserable little rats of ponies, and carrying
numbers of banners, the colour and device of which will,
they believe, strike terror into the hearts of the enemy;
even the Japanese war seems to have been powerless to
disabuse them of this idea.
</p>

<p>
On our arrival at the eastern gate of the city we mounted
the city walls, and looked down upon the suburb, which
had once been the home of 10,000 Chinese Mohammedans.
Not a roof was left; of a big mosque which used to stand
between the city wall and the outskirts of the suburb
scarcely a trace was visible—only a few pillars remained to
mark the spot where all those followers of the Prophet used
to assemble for worship. From looking down on this scene
of desolation, one was able to imagine what would have
occurred had the rebels got the upper hand, and been able
to wreck the city. Had this happened, it is terrible to think
what the fate of our fellow-countrymen within the walls
would have been. It is just possible that, having remained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
neutral, their lives might have been spared, but in the awful
confusion there would have been, this is more than doubtful.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-336.jpg" width="535" height="394" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RUINS OF THE E. SUBURB OF SINING.</p>
</div>

<p>
We spent some time on the wall, while Ridley showed us
all the different points of interest—the road by which the
soldiers came in to relieve the city, the path by which
reinforcements and supplies used to reach the rebels, the
place where the defenders' only serviceable big gun was
mounted, and many spots where encounters had occurred.
At one time there had been an order that every man
entering Sining had to bring in a stone, and piles of these
were lying on the ramparts, ready to be hurled down on the
heads of the insurgents. There were some soldiers of the
garrison lying about on the wall, where, also, their huts
were. Some of these were indebted to the missionaries
for medical treatment and nursing when wounded; they
seemed glad to see Ridley, and to be grateful for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
kindness they had received. On our way back to the
mission-house, and on other occasions, we were able to
ask Ridley how the work of the mission was progressing.
</p>

<p>
There has been a mission-station at Sining for about ten
years, but, unfortunately, the work has not been continuous.
On at least one occasion the station has been given up, and
from time to time breaks have occurred. This has naturally
militated very strongly against the success of the mission,
and the result has been that the number of converts has
been small, and, moreover, one or two of those who were
looked upon as firm believers have fallen away.
</p>

<p>
Thus the missionaries have met with considerable disappointment,
and it is no wonder that there should again
be talk of giving up the station. Mr. and Mrs. Ridley, as
well as Mr. Hall, who has had a very long experience of
Sining, were, however, greatly opposed to this. During
the rebellion they had been able to do a great deal of good
among the townspeople. Numbers had been wounded, and
knowing that they would find friends in need, they had
come to the mission-house for treatment. In this, and in
many other ways, they had been able to gain the confidence
of the people in a way they had never been able to do
before, and, as they all say, now, if ever, is the time we
shall be able to do good. Mr. Ridley, in October, 1896,
had just been offered a transfer to another station, where
there was a church and a fairly large congregation of
Christians, but it was not hard to see that his heart was
set on staying at Sining, and I am glad to think that he
got his wish. Some people may be inclined to ask whether
it is worth while keeping up a mission-station when the
results attained are so small, but it is scarcely fair to judge
merely from the returns of converts and inquirers that are
sent in annually. A great deal of good may be done which
does not come to the surface, and, whatever one's private
opinion and convictions may be, one cannot but admire the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
devotion of those who give up everything for the cause they
consider to be right.
</p>

<p>
On our return to the mission-house we found that in our
absence Hall and Rijnhart had been able to arrange for
mules to take us to Lancheo on the following morning, and
as Ridley had business to settle at the headquarters of the
mission, he agreed to accompany us. We made every
preparation for an early start; Ridley gave us each a
"mantsi," or "priest's begging-bowl," as a memento of our
visit, and Mrs. Ridley filled our saddle-bags with cakes and
other luxuries.
</p>

<p>
In spite of all our forethought, it was late before we had
said our last farewells to Mrs. Ridley and her children, and
further delay was caused by a doubt as to whether the ferry
near the north gate of the city was plying or not. No one
was quite sure, so we decided to leave by the west gate, where
we knew for certain that we should find boats to take us to
the north bank of the Si Ho, along which runs the road,
though by doing so we added about three miles to the day's
journey. We had not gone far before a boy ran after us
from the mission-house, bringing the little terrier "Ruby,"
who had followed us so far; she seemed to realize that there
was more marching in store for her, and not to appreciate
leaving the quarters where she had been so comfortable, for
before long she again disappeared in the crowd. This time
she was not so easily recovered; first one of the muleteers
and then Hall went back to look for her. The former
returned without any news, and I had just given up hope of
ever seeing her again when Hall rode up with her in his
arms, greatly to my delight I need scarcely say. Meanwhile
Ridley and Malcolm had crossed by the ferry and were
some distance on their way, so Rijnhart and I had to push
on hard to overtake them.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Travelling on a road like this, any little landmarks
mentioned by other travellers are eagerly looked for, and on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
this day's march there were two such landmarks, or more
correctly speaking, there should have been two; the first,
thirty li from Sining, a bridge over the Si Ho, mentioned by
Mr. Littledale in his lecture before the Royal Geographical
Society on his return from Pekin; the second, another thirty
li on, was the "Peh Ma Ssï," or "White Horse Temple,"
mentioned by Mr. Rockhill in both his books.<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> Unfortunately,
these are now things of the past; the bridge was
swept away in a flood very soon after Mr. Littledale saw it,
and the White Horse Temple was utterly wrecked by the
fanatical Mohammedans.
</p>

<p>
Owing to our late start, we were only able to do eighty li,
darkness having overtaken us before we got to the stage,
the name of which was Chang Kia Tsai. This was our
first experience of the Chinese inn, and we had certainly
struck a very poor sample of the article; like everything in
the neighbourhood, it had suffered heavily in the rebellion,
and was only just beginning to recover itself. There was,
however, stabling for the animals, and a room with four
walls and parts of a roof for ourselves, containing, of course,
a k'ang, or stove-bed, without which no Chinese room is
complete. We were all ready for bed, and as we had a long
day before us, we had a hasty supper and then turned in.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, the 21st October, we were up long before
daylight, having made up our minds to get to Shang Tan
(140 li) by night. We had left our two remaining mules
with Hall, at Sining, and were now very glad that we had
been able to do so, as looking after and feeding them on
the road would have been a great nuisance, and the further
we took them the less they would have been worth. Ridley
and Rijnhart each rode sturdy little country ponies of their
own, excellent, sure-footed hacks over the rough roads,
but Malcolm and I were both rather uncomfortable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
decidedly insecure, perched up on top of our blankets, on
pack saddles; Lassoo, on the other hand, seemed perfectly
happy, and, like nearly all Asiatics, was quite content to
sit all day on his mule, never dismounting unless told to do
so, or unless it were to get something to eat.
</p>

<p>
All along the road we were able to buy most excellent
bread, which is made in various shapes, with beautifully
white flour; the kinds we appreciated most were the "Ko
kuei," which is made in large round flat loaves, weighing
about three pounds apiece, and the "Huei huei," or,
Mohammedan bread, so called because only the Mohammedans
make it in this shape, which resembles that of the
ordinary cake; these loaves weigh about two pounds, and
have a very nice crust. These larger loaves are sold by the
weight; rolls and smaller loaves are sold at so many cash
each. Bread was dear in 1896, costing thirty to forty cash
a pound (1d. to 1¼d.); in ordinary years it will not be more
than half that price.
</p>

<p>
Ninety li (thirty miles) from Chang Kia Tsai, we got to
Lou Ya. From here there are two roads to Lancheo,
the cart road going off to the left by Ping-Fang, while
the mule track, which is the shorter, follows the river, and
at this point enters the Ta Hsia, the "great gorges," so
called in contradistinction to the "Hsiao Hsia," or "little
gorges," which are about ten miles east of "Sining." The
sun was setting as we entered these gorges, so we missed
seeing some very beautiful scenery at its best; we could,
however, realise how difficult, not to say dangerous, a journey
Mrs. Ridley must have had along this track, when she
had come through in a mule litter a few months previously,
being too ill to travel any other way. For a man on foot,
or for a pack animal, the road was easy enough, even in
the dark, but getting a litter and two mules round some
of the very sharp bends must have been a decidedly risky
proceeding.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVII.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
SHANG TAN—HO TSUI TSI—FIRST VIEW OF THE YELLOW RIVER—ON
A RAFT—AT LANCHEO—A TELEGRAPH TROUBLE.
</p>

<p>
For forty li our road lay through these gorges, most of
the way a considerable height above the river bed, and,
owing to the darkness, our progress was slow, so that it
was not till 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> that we got to our inn. Here we made
inquiries for our baggage, but could get no information,
though we subsequently found out that it and our two
men were at another inn of the same village.
</p>

<p>
Shang Tan lies at the mouth of a river, the Ta T'ung,
which we crossed by a ferry; the missionaries, and any
people holding official positions in the country, are exempted
from paying toll for these ferries, and when travelling, or
sending any property about, they usually carry a flag, with
name and title inscribed in Chinese characters. I had a
flag with my name on it, which was made in Sining, just
to show who the baggage belonged to, but, of course, we
could not claim exemption from tolls. Round Shang Tan
there is a great deal of melon cultivation, and the fields are
covered with stones, which perform the two-fold duty of
protecting the ground from the fierce rays of the sun and
raising the fruit out of the water should it rain heavily.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening we got to Ho Tsui Tsi, the last place in
this direction which was wrecked by the Mohammedans,
and beyond this the difference was at once apparent. Our
halting-place that night was Ma Huei Tsi, a very small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
village, consisting almost entirely of inns; in fact, its
only <i>raison d'être</i> must have been as a convenience for
travellers. Nevertheless, instead of coming to a ramshackle,
tumble-down house, very likely without any front door,
the inn was in good repair, and the roof intact, quite a
change after the stricken district we had passed through.
</p>

<p>
Ten miles from Ma Huei Tsi the road passes over a spur of
the hills, and one gets one's first view of the mighty Huang
Ho (Yellow River). On the other side the road descends to
the pretty little straggling town of Ho K'eo Tsi (the "mouth
of the river") so called because at this point the Si Ho,
which we had followed from some distance above Tankar,
runs into the Yellow River. On both the ascending and
descending sides of this spur, there are earthen pans dug
in the soil, in which salt is collected from the brackish
streams which abound.
</p>

<p>
Ten li further on the river has to be crossed by a ferry
to a town called Sin Ch'eng. When we got there, the ferry
boat was at the far side of the river and the ferrymen busy
doing something else; for about two hours we sat on the
bank shouting to them to come across to us, and every now
and then one of them would shout back that they would be
over presently. At last we got exasperated, and seeing our
hopes of getting into Lancheo that night rapidly vanishing,
we entered into negotiations with a man to take us the rest of
the distance by raft. We had just agreed on the price to
be paid, and the man had gone away to make a few
necessary preparations, when our baggage, which we thought
was still ahead of us, turned up, and at the same time the
ferry boat started to come across from the other side.
</p>

<p>
Shahzad Mir, Esau, and Shukr Ali had had a very
pleasant time; their muleteers had given no trouble, and the
food they had got on the road, filled as it was with oil,
suited their taste admirably. It was now agreed that
Ridley and the baggage should cross by the ferry to Sin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
Ch'eng and come on to Lancheo the next day with all the
servants, while Rijnhart, Malcolm, and I went straight on
on the raft, which was now ready. This raft was a strangely
flimsy conveyance about eight feet by five feet; it was
supported by six inflated deer skins, and over them was lashed
a very light framework, on which we put our blankets. We
were particularly cautioned when getting on board not to
put our feet on the skins for fear of bursting them, and if
possible to step where two cross pieces of the framework met.
</p>

<p>
In a few moments we were seated and waving adieux to
Ridley, who almost simultaneously left the bank in the
ferry boat. In addition to the three of us, there were two
men to manage the raft, so we were pretty well crowded,
and quite unable to shift our positions. When in smooth
water we were some three inches clear and able to keep
more or less dry, but in the rapids, which were of frequent
occurrence, the water kept washing over the frame, thereby
adding considerably to our discomfort. However, the novelty
of the experience kept us amused, and there was plenty of
variety. For a bit all would go smoothly, then in a few
moments we would be in the middle of a rapid, and for the
next minute or two the raft would dance madly round and
round; it was like a panorama where the spectators revolved
instead of the scenes. Now and then a new sensation would
be added, when, going through a shallow, we suddenly
heard the skins scraping along the bottom; but though
amusing and more or less exciting, we had the satisfaction
of knowing that there was no danger. Every now and
then one of the men had to turn round to blow up a skin
from which too much air had escaped; but in spite of this
and their other duties, they found time to extract from
some part of their clothes some singularly uninviting
looking black bread, but before commencing to eat themselves
they, with true Chinese politeness, offered it to us.
We of course refused; however hungry we might have been,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
and however tempting the food might have looked, it would
have been a great breach of etiquette to have availed
ourselves of their offer.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the sun was rapidly setting, and we began to
realise that our chances of getting into the city before the
gates were closed were small. On starting we had been
assured that we could get from Sin Ch'eng to Lancheo, a
distance of seventy li by road, and about the same by
water, in one Chinese hour, which is equal to two English
hours, but we soon realised that this was an impossibility;
double that time looked a great deal nearer the mark.
</p>

<p>
From Sin Ch'eng downwards we had kept passing
numbers of huge water-wheels, which lift the water out
of the river and irrigate the fields in the neighbourhood.
Some of them must have been fully sixty feet in diameter,
and being constructed entirely of wood are very curious.
Sometimes they are single and sometimes in groups of four
or five; at intervals, when not anxiously watching the
setting sun, I kept thinking what interesting pictures these
wheels would make, but the kodak was with the baggage
and the opportunity lost.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Rijnhart had been making inquiries as to
what chance we had of getting a raft at Lancheo, on which
to continue our journey down the Yellow River. All along
the road reports had been most conflicting, some people
telling us that rafts were constantly leaving with wool for
various places down the river, others telling us that we
should have to go some distance by land, and then get
a boat or a raft below the gorges. All we knew for certain
was that Mr. and Mrs. Littledale had managed to get on to
a raft at Lancheo, and we did not see why we shouldn't do
likewise. Now, however, we seemed to be within measurable
distance of the truth, for the owner of our raft told us that
he would take us to an inn in the suburbs where we would
be able to get all the information we required. It was now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
too late for us to get into the city, so this arrangement
suited us admirably.
</p>

<p>
Night came on as we entered the outskirts of the city, and
by the time we disembarked it was quite dark. In single
file we wended our way to the inn; one of the men, carrying
the raft, brought up the rear. Arrived there, we got half a
room, which was not made more agreeable by a Chinaman
smoking opium heavily in the other half, and in a few
moments the landlord brought us some tea. From him we
learnt that a raft was leaving with wool the very next
morning, and that we might be able to induce the owners to
wait till the evening, or at all events until our baggage
should come in; this was excellent news, and we went to
sleep well contented and happy in the thought that on the
morrow we should be able to telegraph home, and allay any
fears that might have arisen with regard to our safety.
</p>

<p>
The first thing next morning we saw one of the owners of
the raft, but all we got out of him was, that he must go
and see his friends, and that he would let us know. Whatever
his intentions were at the time, we never saw him
again. We then went to the telegraph office and despatched
our messages, a proceeding which took us very nearly an
hour, as many different people had to be consulted on so
unusual a proceeding, telegrams to India puzzling the
officials terribly. We also sent a wire and prepaid the
reply, asking when the Gulf of Pe Chili was likely to be
frozen over. At last the matter was settled, as we thought,
so we made our way to the mission house. We had sent up
a note announcing our arrival and saying that we would
follow ourselves a little later. There we found Mr. and
Mrs. Botham, Mr. Hunter, and Mr. Mason, who received us
very cordially in their comfortable home. As soon as
introductions were over, Rijnhart left to make inquiries
about a raft, and shortly afterwards Ridley turned up,
having made a very early start from Sin Ch'eng.
</p>

<p>
In Lancheo there is a Roman Catholic mission, as well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
as the China Inland Mission, but the two never mix, or
associate in any way; for some reason, they find that the
work does not admit of any intercourse between the two
branches of the Church, so, by mutual consent apparently,
they keep apart. From an outsider's point of view, this
seems a pity, but no doubt experience has shown that it is
the wiser plan. The China Inland Mission station has
been established a good many years, and although they
have not yet got a large enough number of converts and
inquirers to have a church, they have been getting on
slowly in the right direction. Being in the capital of
Kansu, it is the principal station of that province, and
the headquarters of the superintendent, to which post
Mr. Botham has just been appointed, after spending many
years in the Hsian plain.
</p>

<p>
We had not been long in our new quarters before
Rijnhart came back, saying that several rafts had left that
morning, and that no others would be leaving for several
days; he had also ascertained that the best thing we could
now do would be to take carts as far as a place called Chong
Wei, and trust to get a boat there to take us on. This we
decided to do, so Mr. Hunter and I went off to make the
necessary arrangements, while Rijnhart and Malcolm went
into the town to buy provisions for the road.
</p>

<p>
Just as they were leaving, the head telegraph official
came round and said that he had despatched the telegram
to Tien Tsin about the state of the Gulf of Pe Chili, but
that he could not send off the others as he was unable to
ascertain what the cost would be; moreover, he had just
heard from Hsian Fu that the wire was broken beyond
that place, and that our message would have to go by
Yamen runners for three days. Very useful this, when we
had hoped to get an answer in forty-eight hours at the
latest. With regard to the English and Indian telegrams,
we were able to surmount the difficulty by wiring to the
headquarters of the China Inland Mission at Shanghai, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
Mr. Botham's name, asking them to send the messages for
us, a request with which they very kindly complied, but,
owing to our not touching Shanghai on our way to India,
it was some months before we were able to repay them.
</p>

<p>
By the evening we had made all our necessary preparations
for another start on the following morning, and Ridley
added to the many kindnesses he had already done us by
lending us some money for current expenses on the road.
Moreover, Rijnhart now finally made up his mind to
accompany us all the way to the coast; he had business to
do there, and this seemed to him a favourable opportunity
for going down to do it. We were both delighted at the
prospect of his companionship through China, where his
knowledge of the people and their language was bound to
be invaluable to us, besides saving us from wholesale
swindling. Many and many a time we had reason to thank
our stars that he came to this decision.

<p class="ch_summ">
WE PAY OFF SHUKR ALI—LANCHEO TO CHONG WEI—OFFICIAL
INCIVILITY—LOSE RUBY—SHAHZAD MIR MISTAKEN FOR A
REBEL.
</p>

<p>
Soon after daybreak on the 25th October we bade farewell to
the missionaries, and, accompanied by Ridley and Rijnhart,
made our way to the inn on the far side of the river, from
which our carts were to start, and in which our men had
slept the previous night. Our baggage was now of the most
miscellaneous description, for in addition to the instruments,
clothes, and flowers which we had brought with us, there were
the curios we had bought, and last, but not least, provisions of
bread, meat, vegetables, and butter for a seven days' journey
across a sandy desert country, where little could be bought,
the inns providing accommodation, but scarcely anything else.
</p>

<p>
We were determined not to starve any more, and made
due preparations to guard against doing so. To carry these
numerous articles, as well as ourselves and our men, we had
engaged two carts, each drawn by a mule and a pony. As
when hiring baggage mules, so again now a regular contract
had to be drawn up and signed by the contracting parties.
Our agreement was that each cart was to carry 500 Chinese
pounds, equal to 666 English pounds, including passengers,
and to land us in Chong Wei on the 31st October. There is
also another and bigger sort of cart in this part of China,
which carries 1,200 pounds, and is drawn by three animals,
but it was not suited to our requirements.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As usual in making a start, the first day there was considerable
delay, and even after everything was ready as far
as we were concerned our carters flatly refused to start till
another party, consisting of two officials—one military, the
other customs-house—who were going to Ning-Shia-Fu, were
also prepared to make a move, and this was not till just
11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, some five hours after leaving the mission-house.
</p>

<p>
Our last care before starting was to pay off Shukr Ali,
whom we were sending back to Ladakh <i>viâ</i> Yarkand. The
inn which we were leaving for Chong Wei was also
the inn from which the carts make their departure for
Yarkand, so we arranged with the innkeeper that he was to
keep Shukr Ali until a caravan should be starting, leaving
him a sum of money for board and lodging, Ridley, moreover,
very kindly promising to see that the innkeeper did
not defraud him or delay his departure.
</p>

<p>
Some months later we heard that Shukr Ali had arrived
in Kashgar, where he presented himself to the British Resident,
Captain Macartney, and coolly stated that he had
been defrauded of a portion of his just dues. He appears,
however, to have omitted to mention the fact of his desertion
with the remainder of our flour, or any of his many
sins of omission and commission by which he had forfeited
all claim to any consideration. We did, indeed, send him
Rs. 40 in answer to the appeal of the Resident, but with a
special request that he should be made to clearly understand
that he was in no way entitled to it. I can only hope that
this was done. Had it not been for the fact that his behaviour
up to the 2nd August was infinitely better than that of the
other men, we would certainly never have taken him back
into our service.
</p>

<p>
The usual method of cart travelling in China is to make
an early morning start, to halt a couple of hours about midday,
and then to go on till sunset, or rather later; but as the
animals travel at a walk the whole time, the amount of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
ground covered is not very great—in fact, if you manage
to do forty miles in a day you may congratulate yourself on
having done well. Our first day's journey was only seventy
li, or about twenty-three miles, and then we halted for the
night at Shui-Peh-Ho. The following day, during our midday
halt, we made the acquaintance of some of our fellow-travellers,
after which they generally used to come and
converse with us while we were having our meals, and
occasionally made themselves very entertaining. The road
was dull and uninteresting in the extreme, very rough and
very sandy, which made the work uncommonly hard for the
animals; scarcely a sign of cultivation anywhere, except
just round the small groups of houses occasionally to be
seen, which seem to have no <i>raison d'être</i>, except to
supply the wants of destitute travellers, should any come
along the road. In some places things are so bad that the
unfortunate people have to send several miles for their
water, but somehow the advisability of shifting to a more
favourable part of the country never seems to strike them.
</p>

<p>
One day the monotony of our journey was broken by a
slight <i>fracas</i> between the carters and ourselves, they having
made up their minds to stop for the day at 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, while we
were equally determined that they should go on another
fifty li. Halting so early made it quite impossible for them
to land us in Chong Wei on the day they had agreed upon,
but this did not appear to affect them in the least, and
threats of taking them to the Yamen at Chong Wei were
equally unavailing, so that I am bound to confess that they
fairly beat us, and we remained stuck in a little village for
the rest of the day.
</p>

<p>
On the 31st October, the day our cart journey should have
ended, we were woken up at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, the carters saying they
were in a hurry to start. Nothing loth, we made a hasty
breakfast, rolled up our blankets, and made every preparation
for departure. Our fellow-travellers moved off, but there were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
no signs of our carts getting ready, so we went outside to
inquire what had happened to them, and were informed
that one pony had run away, and that the men had gone in
search of it, so there was nothing to do but to return to the
inn and await events. Soon tiring of this, I decided to
stroll on ahead, never doubting that the others would soon
follow me in the carts.
</p>

<p>
The men had already gone on, so, taking Ruby with
me, I set off down the road, which soon developed into a
succession of sand hills, with many cart ruts in several places
nearly two feet deep—anything but pleasant walking in the
dark. It did not take me long to catch up to the men, but by
this time I had been deserted by Ruby, the faithful companion
of so many days' travelling. This troubled me little at the
time, as I quite made up my mind that, not relishing the keen
morning air, she had returned to the inn to put in as much
more sleep as possible.
</p>

<p>
After going about thirteen miles I came to a small village,
where I tried to get some bread, but my endeavours being
unsuccessful, whether owing to some flaw in my Chinese or
not I cannot say, I decided to walk on to the next place.
On I went, following the cart tracks, which formed an
apology for a road, down the bed of a narrow stream, and
between high cliffs, till I at length emerged on the banks of
what was undoubtedly our old friend the Yellow River. I
knew I could not be mistaken in this, as there is no other
river in this part of China with anything like the same
volume of water. The tracks led me along the left bank of
the river, till they eventually stopped abruptly at the water's
edge. High above me I could see a track across some forbidding-looking
sand hills, but to reach it one had a difficult
piece of ground to negotiate which was utterly impracticable
for carts. I knew there was no other road by which the
carts could go, and, as far as I could see, there was no
possibility of their getting any further. It was now about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
midday. We were all very hungry, and quite at a loss what to
do, so, in default of any better plan, I made up my mind to
wait where I was till Rijnhart and Malcolm should arrive; so,
choosing a shady spot, I lay down, and was soon fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
It was about 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> when I woke, refreshed by sleep, but
still very hungry, and anxious for the arrival of the carts,
which, however, were nowhere to be seen; but just as it was
getting dusk, a boat came round a bend of the river, being
dragged up the far side by sturdy Chinamen. They went a
short distance further up the river than where I was, and
then dropped across to my side. This was evidently a ferry-boat,
and was in the habit of meeting carts and travellers at
intervals during the day, so, feeling sure it was certain to
take me somewhere, I got on board with the men, expecting
to be ferried across to some village on the far side, which
was hidden by the curve of the bank, but to my astonishment
we went straight down the river, about half a mile.
Here the boat stopped, and out we all got. The boatmen
moored the boat for the night, and then started off across
some fields. I followed in silence, wondering what the upshot
of it all was likely to be. There I was, a stranger in a strange
land, destitute of money and food, and quite unable to speak
the language, or make myself understood except occasionally
by signs. And in this Shahzad Mir, Esau, and Lassoo, were
of no help; they were indeed only extra mouths to feed, and no
money to do it with. After walking about half a mile we came
to a small group of houses, and one of the boatmen, a good
sort of fellow, made signs for us to follow him into one of
them. Here we found an old lady, evidently his wife, and
to our great delight our demands for "momo" (bread) and
"tsa" (tea) were promptly complied with. We had indeed
fallen upon our feet, for in addition to these luxuries the
room was clean and comfortable, but all efforts to make our
host and hostess understand that we would like some eggs
availed us nothing. Even when we all four sat in a row, each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' name='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
making the noise he imagined was most like a laying hen,
our object never dawned upon them, and at last, when it
became obvious that they thought this was only our way of
enjoying ourselves, we gave up in despair and went to sleep.
</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE ROAD FROM LANCHEO, CHINA.</p>
</div>

<p>
Next morning, after more bread and tea, I went out and
anxiously looked up the river for signs of the ferry-boat or
the carts, but nothing occurred till about midday, when the
carters arrived leading their animals, and now, for the first
time I really grasped the meaning of the abruptly ending
cart road, the steep track over the sand hills, and the ferry-boat.
The carts are dragged down as far as possible by the
animals, which are then unharnessed, led up the steep
cliff and across the sand hills down to the village in which I
had passed the night, and in the meanwhile the carts are
shipped on to the ferry-boat and brought down until the road
again becomes fit for wheeled traffic.
</p>

<p>
Soon after Rijnhart and Malcolm arrived with the carts
in the boat, which this time came right down to the village,
but, to my great sorrow, Ruby was not with them, nor had
they seen her. It certainly seemed hard that, after travelling
so many miles, she should be lost when comparatively near
the goal. It appeared that the pony had not returned the
previous morning till nearly seven, and that the carters
had again struck work and insisted on stopping for the night
at the village through which I had passed after my unsuccessful
attempt to get bread. They had said that they could
not possibly get to the ferry that night, and that, as they had
no intention of sleeping in the open, they would go no further.
</p>

<p>
However, now that we were all united, our first care was
to start off the men in the carts for Chong Wei, while we
got a raft for ourselves to take us down the river. The
whole party was in motion again by 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and about
half an hour before sunset we got down to our landing
place, a sort of coal wharf about two miles from the city
of Chong Wei.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We had previously agreed with our carters to go to a
certain inn in the east suburb, so we made our way there as
quickly as possible, expecting the carts to come in before
night. In this, however, we were disappointed, but it was a
matter of indifference to us, as our men had plenty of money
and were perfectly safe. The innkeeper made us a capital
supper of mutton and rice, and while we were discussing it,
a Chinaman, who turned out to be an agent for one of the
wool firms, with that easy familiarity characteristic of the
race, came in and gave us all the news of the place; and
from him we learnt that there was another foreigner living
near the west gate of the city, so we made up our minds to
visit him in the morning and find out the best way of getting
on to Pao T'eo.
</p>

<h3>
<span class="smcap">Chong Wei.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Soon after daylight the next morning we started off to the
wharf, where the wool boats lie while taking in cargo, in
hopes that we might be able to get a passage in one as far
as Ning-Shia-Fu or Shih-Tsui-Tsi, or, failing in that, that
we might be able to hire a boat for ourselves. In this we
failed, the prices asked being absolutely prohibitive, and we
also learnt that another and hitherto unthought-of danger
was staring us in the face, and that was that it was quite
possible that the river would freeze below Shih-Tsui-Tsi in
a very few days, in which case we should have to make a
tedious camel journey through the Ordos country to Pao
T'eo, by no means a pleasant look-out in the wintry weather
that was now coming on; but as a set-off against this we
heard that Messrs. Forbes &amp; Co., the wool merchants, whose
agent we had met at Tankar, had an office just opposite the
inn in which we were lodging, and that very possibly they
might be able to help us on our journey.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-361" id="i-361"></a>
<img src="images/i-361.jpg" width="521" height="331" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STREET IN THE TONG KUAN (E. SUBURB), CHONG WEI, YELLOW RIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>
With this information to cheer us we rushed back to the
town and into Forbes's office, where we found all the agents
and principal men discussing a hearty breakfast, of which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344' href='#Page_344'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
they invited us to partake, but we refused, contenting ourselves
with tea, without which no business or pleasure can
be conducted in China. As soon as breakfast was over, the
two senior agents turned their attention to our wants. After
examining our credentials, consisting of the two letters from
our old friend Chen-Lao-Pan, they told us that they would
do all they could to help us, and that, as they had a boat
starting on the next day but one, they would arrange for
passages for ourselves, our men, and 500 pounds of baggage.
In this we were to be taken to Shui-Tsui-Tsi, where we
would find another of their agents, who would doubtless
do his best to help us on, either by river or by land. In
return we were to pay the sum of 12,000 cash, an exorbitant
sounding sum, but one which represents in English money
about £1 15<i>s.</i> As an alternative route we might have gone
by carts as far as Ning-Shia-Fu, and thence by boat, camels,
or other means to Pao T'eo; but after mature consideration
we came to the conclusion that the water journey would be
the more convenient, and probably the more speedy, so closed
with their offer at once.
</p>

<p>
This was a good morning's work, and we crossed the
street to breakfast in our inn, almost as hungry as we had
been in Tibet. We were followed immediately into the
yard by our carts and servants, so, to save any bother, we
paid the former off at once, and, such is the cheek of the
Chinese carter, they grumbled at not getting wine money
in addition to the full amount of Ts. 19, for which they
should have landed us in Chong Wei two days sooner than
they actually had. The altercation thus caused collected
rather a crowd, who were far from being as civil as those we
had hitherto met—in fact, Chong Wei was the only place in
China where we experienced any inconvenience from the
inquisitive objection to foreigners of which one hears so
much; but had it not been for Rijnhart we might have got
into serious trouble here, as will be seen later. One man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
among the crowd demanded to see our cards, stating that
he was a messenger from the Yamen, and that he had
been sent down officially. Rijnhart promptly demanded
the big man's card as a proof of <i>bona fides</i>, knowing full
well that no Chinese would ever send a messenger on an
errand like this without this mark of respect. On his failure
to produce it, Rijnhart refused to give up ours, and how
right he was became evident when we found our friend to
be nothing but a street loafer. Had we been in the hands
of an ordinary interpreter, we might have acceded to this
demand, and thus become an object of ridicule to all the
bystanders. The crowd now saw that one at least of the
party was well acquainted with Chinese customs, and mended
their manners accordingly, their behaviour being still
further improved on the arrival of one of Mr. Forbes's agents,
who had a few remarks to make. Nevertheless, though no
longer offensive, we had to place Shahzad Mir near the
entrance to our apartment to prevent them crowding too
close round while we were eating.
</p>

<p>
On some occasions our worthy guard was called away
from his post for another purpose, when the inquisitive
crowd would at once take advantage of his absence, and a
mass of peering faces would obscure all the air and nearly
all the light from the door of our little room. A toe over
the threshold invited a rap from one of our sticks, but
still we required more ventilation and adopted a plan and
a surprise quite novel to the Chinaman. Seizing a tumbler
full of water, either Malcolm or I would fling the contents
on them, and at the same time laugh right merrily, and,
although annoyed at the time we could not help doing
this at the result. The crowd at once dispersed on every
side; those who had been unfortunate in getting a wetting
at first became enraged, but those who had escaped were
only too glad to join us in our chaff against their fellow-countrymen.
Had we put on a serious mien all would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' name='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
have united in abusing us and we should never have
enjoyed a moment's breathing space. The only time we
really found peace was at dusk, when the innkeeper
closed the big gates of the yard, and only those living at
the inn were allowed inside. We wished that dusk had
reigned during the whole of our stay at Chong Wei.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast over, Rijnhart and I started to find out the
foreigner of whom we had heard the previous night, and
also to pay a visit at the Yamen, where I thought I might
be able to get some further information about our journey
to the coast. In this, however, I was unsuccessful, and a
very few moments sufficed to show me that any incivility
shown to foreigners would certainly not incur the disapproval
of the Yamen. Our reception was very different
from anything we had experienced at any of the other
Yamens. My visiting card, a brilliant crimson piece of
paper, with my name in black Chinese characters, was the
same size as that used by generals and others of equal
rank, <i>i.e.</i>, nearly a foot in length, and had hitherto always
commanded respect, but was here treated with contempt,
the doorkeeper refusing to take it in to the mandarin, while
the crowd kept insolently jostling and shoving against us.
Even my passport, elsewhere a regular "open sesame," in
which I was referred to in the most flattering terms, was of
little good; and even when we were finally admitted it was
not into the presence of the big man himself, but only of
his head clerk, who did not even offer us chairs, but adopted
a tone of insolence such as only a Chinese jack-in-office can.
</p>

<p>
Rijnhart was equal to the occasion, and soon showed him
that his arrogant tone did not impress us with a sense of
his importance as he had doubtless hoped it would do; but
seeing that nothing was to be gained by stopping there, we
left as soon as we possibly could, and went in search of the
foreigner. We had no difficulty in finding out his inn,
and most highly surprised and delighted he appeared at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
seeing us. It was evident from his surroundings that he
had been living a very solitary life and was practising the
strictest asceticism; luxury there was none.
</p>

<p>
It soon turned out that he and Rijnhart were old acquaintances,
having landed in China about the same time, and
thus the ice was speedily broken, and I quickly learnt that
our new friend's name was Mr. Lumberg, that he was a
Swede, and belonged to that branch of the International
Mission Alliance. He had been some months in Chong Wei
trying to open a mission station, but so far, owing to the
opposition of the Yamen, he had not been very successful.
He was very anxious to hire a house, but, although many
of the townspeople were willing to let, the Yamen people
secretly but effectually stopped them doing so, at the same
time assuring Mr. Lumberg that they were doing all they
could to help him, even going so far as to put up notices
in public places proclaiming his wants. The petty official
of Chong Wei was thus able to gratify his personal spite
against foreigners while guarding against the displeasure of
his superior at Lancheo, a man well known to be favourably
disposed towards them.
</p>

<p>
When we returned to our inn, Lumberg accompanied us,
and eventually we persuaded him to send for his bedding
and spend the night with us. It was now, for the first
time, that we heard what a hornet's nest Mr. Littledale
had raised by his remarks before the Royal Geographical
Society, about sending unprotected Swedish girls to live in
out-of-the-way parts of China. Well meant as these remarks
undoubtedly were, the Swedes considered that his object
was to strike a blow at their missionary enterprise, and
when the matter was taken up by the Swedish Government,
it roused a feeling of resentment that will not die out for
some time, and which, in some cases, seemed to extend to
the whole race of Englishmen. Although we were invariably
treated with the greatest hospitality, one could not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349' href='#Page_349'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>351</a></span>
help seeing that this feeling existed. From the accounts
we heard, it certainly seemed as though these remarks were
a little unnecessary, and certainly not one of those ladies of
whom Mr. Littledale spoke with such sympathy has ever
thanked him for it. We were assured that unmarried girls
were never sent to out-stations alone, but were invariably
sent to live with a married couple, and every precaution
taken to guard them from any danger. At the same time,
there is no doubt that Mr. Littledale's intention has been
misunderstood, and could this misunderstanding be cleared
up, I think it would be all for the better.

<p>
That evening, while walking in the streets, accompanied
by Shahzad Mir, an incident occurred, which, but for
Rijnhart's shrewdness and knowledge of the Chinese, might
have landed us in a row. Shahzad Mir was dressed in
semi-European clothes, and being an unmistakable Mohammedan,
some of the people jumped to the conclusion that
he was a "Salar" in disguise. No sooner had this idea
been started than it spread rapidly. A crowd collected,
and began following us, shouting excitedly. We quickened
our pace slightly, and told Shahzad Mir not to get separated
from us. The crowd and shouting gradually increased, and
things were looking awkward, when, seizing his opportunity,
Rijnhart suddenly turned round and addressed the crowd,
saying that he knew for certain that Shahzad Mir had been
travelling for six months since he left his home, and that,
as the Salars lived comparatively close by, he could not
possibly be one of them. This pacified them for a bit, and
while they discussed the probability or otherwise of Shahzad
Mir being a Salar we quickly left the city and turned into
the suburb, which was comparatively quiet; and the only
result of the disturbance was that our faithful Duffadar was
confined to the inn during the remainder of our stay in that
place, while we ourselves never entered the city itself unless
accompanied either by Lumberg or Rijnhart.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIX.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ20">
MISSIONARY YARNS—CHEAP LIVING—ON THE YELLOW RIVER
AGAIN—CASH.
</p>

<p>
The room we occupied in our inn, which was the only one
available, could not have been more than twelve feet by
eight feet, and half this space was occupied by the indispensable
k'ang. Not having, as yet, acquired the Chinese
art of squatting cross-legged on the k'ang, and eating off
a little stool about eight inches high, we were obliged to
squash ourselves into the remaining space, which just
enabled Esau to bring our dinner to the door and hand it
in to one of us—there was no room for him inside till one
of us went out. Nevertheless we managed to enjoy ourselves
immensely, Lumberg forming a pleasant addition
to our party. He and Rijnhart managed to keep us very
much amused with stories of the mistakes they and others
had made in talking Chinese, soon after landing in the
country—mistakes that are rendered even more common
by the numerous differences of dialect met with in the
different districts.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion Rijnhart, when preaching in the streets,
was exhorting his audience "to taste our religion, and see
if it is good," saying, "If you see a pear, and want to know
whether it is good or not, you bite it, and taste it, and then,
if you find it good, you eat it." He had been going on in
this strain for a short time, when he was suddenly interrupted
by a bystander, who said, "But, teacher, you people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
don't eat dogs, do you?" Rijnhart having, unfortunately,
used the Chinese for dog instead of that for pear.
</p>

<p>
There is another story of a famous missionary, who,
owing to differences in dialect in a district he had not
previously visited, addressed the devil, instead of the Lord,
at a public prayer meeting. Similar mistakes are very
common, and are bound to be so in a language where the
slightest inflection of the voice gives a totally different
meaning to the words.
</p>

<p>
It was quite late that night before we went to bed, but as
we had nothing to do the next day, it was a good opportunity
for sitting up, talking and hearing about the Chinese
people, from men who knew as much about them as our
two missionary friends did. We had learnt from our own
short experience that living in China was not by any means
expensive, but it surprised us not a little to hear that
Lumberg and his servant managed on one hundred cash a
day (rather under twopence each). I do not suppose there
is another country in the world where this could be done.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we went early into the city to see the
market—a very busy scene, as people come in every
morning from the country, bringing meat and vegetables,
and the streets are crowded; quite different from the previous
evening, when they had presented an almost deserted
appearance, until the people got suddenly suspicious about
Shahzad Mir. Besides this daily market, Chong Wei has
another peculiarity. Like every town of importance, it is
surrounded by a high wall, but unlike any other place we
saw, it has only three gates, for instead of a north gate,
a temple has been built, which guards the town from evil
spirits, who, as every one knows, always come from the
north. We had to lay in stores for our boat journey down
the river, and as Mr. Forbes's agent asked us to be sure to
have everything ready in ample time, we thought that
there was no doubt that we would soon be on our way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
down the Yellow River. Most of our buying was done by
Lumberg's servant, a Christian convert from Ning-Shia-Fu,
the cleanest and nicest Chinaman we met on our travels,
who saved us an enormous amount of trouble, and got
everything much cheaper than we could have done.
</p>

<p>
By night we were quite ready for departure, and had
been assured that we should start by midday at the very
latest. Accordingly, next morning, we were on board by
11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when we heard for the first time that there was
no chance of leaving till the next morning, and that we
should have to make an eight days' journey across the
desert from Shih-Tsui-Tsi to Pao T'eo, as no boats could
go so far down the river so late in the year. A pleasant
prospect this, with hard frost every night, and no arrangements
for camping! Altogether, we did not feel very
amiably disposed towards the gentleman who had told us
that we must be ready to start by midday. However,
remonstrances were useless, and we had to make the best
of it.
</p>

<p>
Next morning our inquiries were always met by the
invariable answer that we were going to start at once, but
the bill of lading had been incorrectly made out, and had to
be rectified. Other delays cropped up, and it was just on
2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> when the skipper appeared and we pushed off into
the stream. However, the delay was acceptable in one
way, for it enabled Lumberg to come down and see us
again, with the welcome news that he had been able to
arrange to get rooms in a new inn in the east suburb, and
his troubles on that score were at an end.
</p>

<p>
Once under weigh, we travelled pretty fast. The stream
was strong and carried us down grandly, but, after going
a couple of hours, the skipper insisted on tying up for the
night, saying that there was a nasty place ahead which
they could not possibly pass in the dusk; a very feeble
excuse, the real reason being that some of the crew lived in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
a village close by. We had been in hopes of travelling all
night, and had certainly been led to believe that we should
do so, but nothing, apparently, was further from the
intentions of the skipper and his crew. There was nothing
for it but to set to work to make ourselves as comfortable
as we could in the boat.
</p>

<p class="caption">OUR WOOL BOAT ON THE YELLOW RIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>
These wool-boats on the Yellow River are flat-bottomed,
and very clumsily, though strongly built. They are from
thirty to forty feet long, and ten or twelve feet wide. The
ends are decked over for about nine feet, the remainder of
the boat being divided off by partitions. As a rule, they
trust to the stream to carry them down, the steering being
done with a long sweep, but occasionally they use two other
long sweeps to row. Up stream they are obliged to tow.
The decked portion in the bows was left free of cargo for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
our accommodation, while that in the stem was allotted to
the crew and to our servants, and in it all the cooking was
done. Matters were a good deal simplified by our men and
the boatmen all being Mohammedans, with the exception
of Esau, who had no religious objection to eating with any
one, believer or unbeliever. Besides ourselves, there were
three or four Chinese passengers going to different places
down the river, their passage-money being the skipper's
perquisite. All the remaining available space was piled up
with wool, piled up as high as was safe, till the gunwale
was only a few inches above the water. But for the danger
of sticking on mud banks—a by no means infrequent
occurrence—I fancy they would have been loaded even
more deeply.
</p>

<p>
In addition to our own, there were four more boats going
down stream in company with us, a circumstance we had
reason to regret before very long, as on the very next
day, the 6th November, just as we were making most satisfactory
progress, one of these boats stuck about half-past
three in the afternoon, and we had to wait till she got off.
As she was still ashore at sunset, we made no more progress
that day, and several valuable hours were lost. Next morning
six men went to the other boat and began unloading
the wool—a very tedious process—but, about 10.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
they got her off, and she came down towards us.
</p>

<p class="caption">HALTING FOR THE NIGHT ON THE YELLOW RIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>
While waiting here, we had managed to pass the time
watching a ferry plying just below the spot where we were
tied up. Mongols, Chinese, camels, sheep, and bullocks,
all were piled in promiscuously, and taken across from one
side to the other, being washed down a very considerable
distance in the transit. All of a sudden a tremendous
row started between the parties, apparently as to which
had the right to be taken over first. They were fairly
evenly divided and equally determined. Abuse was plentiful,
and a free fight seemed imminent, when, somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' name='Page_357' href='#Page_357'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358' href='#Page_358'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359' href='#Page_359'>359</a></span>
to our disappointment, we were called upon to renew our
journey, thus being robbed of the one possible compensation
for our hours of delay.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-377.jpg" width="526" height="423" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A FERRY ACROSS THE HUANG HO.</p>
</div>

<p>
About 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> that day we had to pass the customs-house
at the border of the Ning-Shia district, and here our
skipper was detected smuggling ten bales of pears; the
officials wanted to stop us all night, but a few words from
Rijnhart pacified them, and on we went. Unfortunately
the pears were not yet ripe, or we would have exacted
heavy toll in return for our good offices. We had only
managed another ten li, before we stopped for the night, at
a small village on the right bank of the river, from which
the skipper started off to walk twenty li to his own home.
We were sick of the constant delays and stoppages, and as
there were several boats tied up along the shore, we landed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' name='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>360</a></span>
and tried to find the owners, in hopes of being able to buy
or hire a boat for ourselves, to go as far down the river as
possible.
</p>

<p>
After some time we were successful, for a young and
enterprising Mohammedan agreed to take us all the way to
Pao T'eo, without stopping day or night, for the sum of
Ts.70 (somewhere about £13). The price was high, but
we returned to the wool-boat with a happy feeling of
independence, which was increased when we heard that we
should not be able to start the next morning until the
other boats came down from the customs-house. We had,
at first, been asked Ts.120 for the boat, and told we should
have to wait a day, but we insisted on starting the following
morning, and having knocked down the price to nearly
one half, felt that we had not done badly.
</p>

<p>
As with riding mules and carts, so with the boat, an
agreement was necessary, and this the village schoolmaster
drew up for us; but by this time our skipper had returned,
and was furious at finding that such a grand opportunity
of squeezing the foreigner had slipped through his fingers.
He did his best to frighten our new friend into backing out
of his bargain, but did not quite succeed, and eventually
went off down stream in a towering rage. We still had
one more difficulty to overcome, a somewhat serious one,
and one we did not quite understand, but eventually it
transpired that our new skipper was trying to buy an old
boat, not wanting to take his own to Pao T'eo and perhaps
get her frozen in there. The owner of the old boat saw his
opportunity, and was not slow to take advantage of it, as
he would not take less than Ts.30, about three times its
value under ordinary circumstances.
</p>

<p>
At last everything was settled, and about 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we
started, soon passing the wool-boats, which were tied up as
usual. We found our craft pretty leaky, but by laying
down a flooring of boughs and straw, and keeping up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' name='Page_361' href='#Page_361'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' name='Page_362' href='#Page_362'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' name='Page_363' href='#Page_363'>363</a></span>
constant baling, we kept her very comfortable, and after all
our chief anxiety was to travel rapidly. Part of our agreement
was that we were to stop at Shih-Tsui-Tsi to take in
fresh supplies, but that for every unnecessary delay the
boatmen were to be fined one tael.

ALL THE "CASH" ISSUED FROM THE FIRST OF THE EMPERORS OF THE

</div>

<p>
The stream was very strong, and, as the weather was
cold, we used to row with the long sweeps to keep ourselves
warm during the day, and the boatmen, of whom there
were four, including the owner, rowed at night to keep
themselves awake. This boat was built exactly the same
as the other, but as there was no cargo we had plenty of
room, and stood on the partitions to row; another advantage
of having no cargo was that we drew very little water,
and scarcely ever touched the bottom. The country on
either shore was very flat and uninteresting, while the river,
sometimes about two miles in width, was a succession of
mud banks and shallows.
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock on the 9th November we got to Shih-Tsui-Tsi,
and presented the letter of credit we had received from
Chen-Lao-Pan. The agent then kindly gave us a guide,
who took us to various shops, where we bought provisions,
mostly bread and vegetables, for the rest of the journey to
Pao T'eo. We did not, however, succeed in getting any
meat, as there was only one sheep available, and that was
not worth buying.
</p>

<p>
Having made our purchases, we returned to the office,
where we found our money ready for us; part of this was
in silver and part in cash. The latter was of very inferior
quality, but, as we were getting it out of civility, and not in
the way of business, we could not well say anything. The
Chinese cash seems to have been purposely invented to
deceive and cheat the unwary; to begin with, every Emperor
makes his own cash, but these are not issued from the mint
until after his death, and many Emperors have thought fit
to economize by issuing inferior coins, which, instead of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
being about the size of our penny, are rather smaller than
a farthing and very roughly made; in fact a very fair
estimate of the various Emperors' characters can be drawn
from the cash they have issued.
</p>

<p>
The accompanying diagrams show the cash of all the
Emperors of the reigning Ts'ing or Manchu dynasty, but
only full-sized specimens have been chosen. These inferior
cash may be accepted as current coin in one place, while
in the next no one will look at them. Cash are always
done up in strings, either of five hundred or a thousand,
and look not unlike strings of sausages, each sausage being
represented by a hundred cash; and here, again, they have
devised a means of fraud, for in some places eighty-five
cash count as a hundred, in others ninety, ninety-two,
ninety-three, and so on, as the case may be, consequently
whenever one arrives at a new town, one has to enquire all
about its coinage.
</p>

<p>
In Tankar they had a very peculiar way of reckoning,
for prices were frequently stated in "small cash," a coin
that does not exist, but whose value is half that of the current
or "street cash." These differences disappeared gradually as
we neared Pekin, and signs of a central government became
more marked, but in and just around the capital itself we
came across a very much larger cash, almost as big as the
old English penny, but then, when dollars and cents became
the currency, we were very little troubled with these coins.
Another difficulty was that, in changing silver in different
towns, the rate of exchange would vary as much as three
hundred cash for an ounce, and the correct rate always had
to be found out in a roundabout way before we presented
our silver for exchange. These are only a few of the traps
into which a novice may fall when attempting to deal in
Chinese coinage. Had we been in the hands of a native
interpreter, instead of those of Mr. Rijnhart, we should
have been splendid prey for the swindlers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' name='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They told us at Shui-Tsui-Tsi that the price of wool was
four cents a pound, but that it was not of such good quality
as that which comes from Tankar. Next to the wool business
the most important occupation seemed to be iron working,
in which a very large portion of the population was engaged.
All the way from Chong Wei we had been passing through
a district which was very rich in coal, and judging from the
number of smithies in Shui-Tsui-Tsi, the district must
possess very considerable mineral wealth, which may some
day be developed.
</p>

<p>
By this time it was quite dark, so we hurried back to the
boat, and started again after a halt which had lasted just
three hours, to make up for which we offered our men an
extra Ts.5 if they landed us in Pao T'eo in four days, <i>i.e.</i>,
by the 9th of the Chinese, or the 13th of the English
month. No time was lost in starting, and all night we
floated down the mighty stream, but how we avoided the
shallows will ever be a mystery to me; a sharp look-out
was always kept, and every now and then a shout, followed
by violent rowing, would tell us that we had just missed
a bank.
</p>

<p>
Not far below Shui-Tsui-Tsi we passed a village situated
in a desolate spot on the left bank, but in spite of its dreary
surroundings it was full of life, numbers of boats were lying
along the banks, all being filled with saltpetre; everyone was
in a hurry to get off before the river should freeze, the whole
scene reminding one of coolies at Port Said coaling a ship.
</p>

<p>
On we went all night and all day floating down the broad
stream, the only break in the days being meal-times. The
nights and early mornings were very cold, and consequently
we spent no inconsiderable part of our time between the
blankets, rising late and going early to bed. At twilight
numbers of water birds, of all sorts and sizes, used to
assemble on the mud banks, uttering weird cries until it
was time for them to go to rest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>366</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One night we narrowly escaped a collision, but no damage
was done, although we managed, somehow or other, to carry
off an oar belonging to the other boat, and had to put
ashore to return it. As we got near to Pao T'eo we could
see mountains on the north bank gradually closing in
towards the river, and about the same place I discovered
one of the clearest echoes I have ever heard, which was,
moreover, sufficiently distant for three or four words to
come back to us across the waters, quite distinct from our
own shouts; shouting and an occasional turn at the sweeps
was our only form of exercise at this time.
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the 18th November we sighted
Pao T'eo, but it was not till 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> that we reached the
termination of our water journey—none too soon, as sleepless
nights had quite worn out the crew. Immediately on
our arrival the boatmen entered into negotiations for the
sale of the rickety old craft which had done us such good
service, but no one seemed anxious to buy, boats being a
drug in the market just before the river freezes.

CHAPTER XXX.

<p class="ch_summ">
PAO T'EO—THE SWEDISH MISSION-HOUSE—CHINESE SCHOOLS—CHINESE
INNS—CHINESE BURIAL—KUEI HUA CHENG—FRICTION
WITH CARTERS—WE LEAVE THE MONGOL COUNTRY—THE
GREAT WALL.
</p>

<p>
The distance to Pao T'eo from the river bank was said to
be fifteen li, so we lost no time in starting to walk there,
leaving the servants and boatmen to bring our baggage to
Messrs. Forbes's office. The fifteen li cannot really have
been much more than nine, for, walking quickly, we got
to the city gate in a little over three-quarters of an hour.
Once inside, we were very much struck by the difference
between this and the other cities we had seen; instead of
crowded streets, with every available yard of ground within
the walls occupied, we here found lanes, almost deserted
except by a few children and pigs, and a large bit of waste
land inside the walls, absolutely untenanted. Not only
had this piece of ground been left severely alone, but two
small suburbs, on the south and east sides respectively,
had sprung up outside. Why so much ground had been
originally enclosed no one could tell us.
</p>

<p>
While asking our way to the office of the wool firm, the
Renki Yang Hong as it was called, we suddenly found ourselves
opposite the entrance of the Swedish Mission-house.
Needless to say, we went in at once, and were heartily
welcomed. While explaining who we were and where we had
come from, coffee was prepared by our hostess, and more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' name='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
delicious coffee I have never tasted; but as we were anxious
to make all arrangements for starting the next morning, we
could not waste time, but had to rush off to the office,
accompanied by the missionaries, who showed us the way.
Before leaving the house, however, they took us into their
school, where we found some five-and-twenty remarkably
clean and happy-looking children, who were being brought
up to Christianity. When we entered they were deep in
study, all reading their lessons at the top of their voices in
every imaginable key. This method of committing the task
to memory is universal throughout China. As soon as any
child has mastered it, he or she holds up a hand, and is
then called up to the desk to repeat it to the master. An
important difference is now observable between the practice
in native and foreign schools, for in the latter they proceed
just as we do at home, but the native teacher makes the
child stand with his back to the desk and his hands behind
him, while the master arms himself with a cane, which
descends remorselessly at the slightest slip.
</p>

<p>
It was not far to the Yang Hong, and old Chen-Lao-Pan's
letter was sufficient to ensure us every civility. Money
was at once forthcoming, and here, for the first time, we
saw and became possessed of a "shoe" of silver, a lump
weighing rather more than fifty ounces; we also got some
more of the ordinary lumps, weighing from three to five
ounces each, for minor current expenses. We had not been
long in the office, and had not drunk more than three cups
of tea each, when the baggage arrived. One of the Swedes
and Malcolm went off with it at once to look for an inn,
while Rijnhart and I stayed to complete the arrangements
and settle with the boatmen, who said that they had sold
their vessel for Ts.5, a considerable loss on the cost price,
but which the hire had more than covered.
</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE ROAD IN CHINA.</p>
</div>

<p>
Malcolm had some difficulty in finding an inn, owing to
large numbers of soldiers being in the city at the time, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369' href='#Page_369'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370' href='#Page_370'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>371</a></span>
at last he was successful, and also arranged with several
carters who were on the look-out for a job to come round
to the mission-house to arrange terms. We had long ago
found out from Chen-Lao-Pan—who had spent many years
in this part of China—how long the cart journey to Pekin
should take us and how much we should pay; and, armed
with this knowledge, our new friends and Rijnhart were
able to get an agreement signed for three carts to do the
journey in thirteen days for Ts.19 apiece, a most admirable
clause being added to the effect that, should they not arrive
up to time, they would only get Ts.9½. Often and often
did we have cause to congratulate ourselves on having had
this inserted, and I strongly recommend any travellers
in China to get some guarantee of this kind whenever
possible.
</p>

<p>
It was with the satisfactory feeling of a good day's work
done that we sat down to supper and enjoyed the luxury of
an unlimited supply of milk, such as we had not enjoyed
since leaving India. After supper we sat up late, our hosts
singing in English, as well as in their native tongue and
Chinese, accompanying themselves or one another on the
guitar, without which no Swedish home is complete; however,
we were reluctantly compelled to say good-night, but
not good-bye, as our hosts promised to come and see us off
on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
There was the usual hitch in starting, caused this time
by the carters discovering that they could not do the distance
to Pekin in less than fourteen days, their reason
being that some carters who had arrived the previous
evening had told them that the road was now very bad.
We tried to make them stick to the original agreement, but
eventually gave way, and had a fresh one drawn up.
Seeing that the usual time occupied in this journey is seventeen
days, their request for an extra day was not unreasonable.
We also had to change some silver into cash for expenditure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' name='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
on the road, and this we entrusted to our landlord while we
took a stroll through the streets.
</p>

<p>
Pao T'eo does not appear to have any distinctive trade
or products of its own. One misses the splendid furs of
Lancheo, the coal of Chong Wei, and the forges of Shih-Tsui-Tsi;
but one notices very large numbers of Mongols,
who bring in wool to the various firms. There were also
numbers of copper Mongol kettles, of which we wanted to
buy some specimens, but were told we could get them
better and cheaper in Pekin. The shops were very much
larger and more well-to-do-looking than anything we had
hitherto seen, and in one grocer's we bought some first-rate
sponge cakes and a sort of apple jam, which was excellent.
Eggs were fairly dear, five cash apiece; in some places we
had paid five cash for two, but near the capital we had to
pay as much as ten cash each. Fancy new-laid eggs at
fourpence a dozen in London!
</p>

<p>
However, the longest delays come to an end at last, and
at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the 14th November we started on the last
stage of our journey. The missionaries walked some little
way with us to the outskirts of the east suburb, and before
leaving they insisted on our promising to visit their countrymen
in the various stations we should pass through.
</p>

<p>
That evening we stopped at a very comfortable inn in
a little town called Salaki. Everywhere were signs that
we were approaching the capital; the streets were better
looked after, and the inn was quite the best we had yet
seen.
</p>

<p>
All Chinese inns seem to be built on the same principle.
One passes through a wide entrance, on one side of which
is the kitchen, on the other a sort of eating-house,
into the courtyard, which varies in size according to the
traffic. Opposite the entrance are the best rooms, kept for
distinguished guests, and all round are smaller rooms for
people of less importance, carters and servants. Every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
room is furnished with a k'ang or stove bed, and the better
class inns have cupboards, tables, and chairs, but only in
the best rooms. As long as one can get into these one can
make oneself fairly comfortable, but should they be occupied
one's lot is not an enviable one. Perhaps the most noticeable
sign of civilization was glass windows, which we saw
for the first time in Pao T'eo, and always daily afterwards.
It was no longer necessary to carry large stores of provisions—these
were obtainable everywhere; but in their
place we had to carry an almost equal weight of cash,
fifteen thousand of which, weighing no less than ninety
pounds, we brought from Pao T'eo.
</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE ROAD FROM PAO T'EO TO PEKIN.</p>
</div>

<p>
Next morning we started soon after sunrise. The shopkeepers
were just taking down their shutters as we left the
inn, and the city was waking up to its daily life; most of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
the people appeared to be engaged in the silk trade, so
I suppose the worm is cultivated somewhere in the neighbourhood.
Unfortunately, as we strolled on ahead of the
carts we took a wrong turning, and had to retrace our steps
almost to the inn before we found out where we had made
the mistake. We then hurried after the carts, only to find
that their road and ours joined almost at the very spot from
which we had turned back. A stern chase is proverbially
a long one, and this was no exception to the rule.
</p>

<p>
Just outside the walls we saw a coffin which was being
conveyed to the corpse's native place for interment, and
this was the means of our learning a rather interesting
Chinese custom. Every Chinaman has three souls, and
on death one of these returns to the city temple, one to
Hades, and one goes to the grave. With the last of these
three a cock is always carried, no matter how far the coffin
may have to be conveyed. In Southern China it is always
a white cock, but in the north there appears to be no hard-and-fast
rule as to colour. When the corpse is finally
buried the unfortunate rooster is slain, and his spirit goes
to keep company with the soul in the coffin.
</p>

<p>
Every one has heard of the importance, in the eyes of
the Chinaman, of being buried in his own home, and the
ships' companies do not fail to take advantage of it, the
passage-money for a dead man being many times that of
a live one. Before starting on one of these journeys the
greatest care is taken to ascertain an auspicious day, months
often elapsing before a sufficiently favourable opportunity
will occur.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th November we arrived at Kuei Hua Cheng.
As we approached the town we passed a "big man." He
was accompanied by three attendants, one riding in front
and two behind, and we were told that anybody of
importance generally rode in this fashion. Kuei Hua
Cheng is a very large town, and is remarkable for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
absence of any sort of city wall, a deficiency for which we
could discover no reason. Instead of the customary wall
we found an extremely dirty entrance, for the road was at
least a foot deep in mud. It hardly seems credible that a
town of such importance—for besides being a large market it
is utilised as the point of departure for numerous caravans—should
be so wanting in this most essential respect. If
this road were ever supplanted by a railway, Kuei Hua
Cheng would become a centre of immense commercial
interest. The sun was setting as we entered the town,
and we had to make the most of the short time remaining
before the shops shut to lay in stores for the next few days,
when we should be crossing the Mongolian grass country,
and unable to purchase anything. Meat, bread, and kua
mien were easily procurable, although the latter was very
much dearer than it had been in Kansu, so it was still
early when we had finished our supper and turned in for
the night. It had been our original intention to visit the
missionaries of this place, where I know we should have
met with that warm-hearted hospitality which they are
ever ready to bestow upon travellers. But supper over,
the visions of an early start the next morning and the cold
outside our inn were arguments too strong to be thrown
aside.
</p>

<p>
Our carters met many friends at the inn, and determined
to enjoy themselves accordingly; much wine was drunk,
and one of them indulged in the luxury of a fight, all of
which, though perhaps pleasant at the time, tended to
prevent a very early start in the morning; further delay
being caused by the carters suddenly thinking that they
would like to take a pickaxe with them, with which they
could improve the road in bad places. This delay enabled
me to take a photograph of a very curious Buddhist temple,
which stands just at the main eastern entrance to the
town. To do this Rijnhart had to give me a leg-up on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' name='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>
to the wall, and it was not without some difficulty that
I attained my object.
</p>

<p>
We were sorry not to be able to see more of this town,
which has been made famous by Huc and Gabet, Younghusband,
and others; but here, as throughout China, "absence
without leave" and "reasons in writing" were our bugbears.
Especially did we regret not being able to see more
of this temple, which is known as "Wu Tai" Temple, and
is covered from top to bottom with figures of Buddha ranged
in rows, and of a very interesting Manchu city which lies
about two miles north-east of Kuei Hua Cheng, and is
called Sin Chen, or the "New City." This was the only
Manchu city we had a chance of seeing, and its broad
streets, planted with trees, and frequented alike by men
and women, would have been a strong contrast to the
ordinary Chinese town.
</p>

<p>
While still waiting for the pickaxe a large flock of our
old friends the sand-grouse passed over our heads, bringing
to our minds the days of plenty and days of hunger we
had passed on the Chang. Almost immediately the pickaxe
arrived, and we made a fresh start, and for the first time
the road showed some signs of having had a little labour
expended on it. Previously there had been nothing but
rough tracks through or round the fields, or, when this
became invisible, the carters would make a road for themselves.
The general direction was well known to them, and
sooner or later they would strike the track again; nor was
it hard to tell when they had done so, as a drop into a rut
some eighteen inches deep was an unmistakable sign that
we were on the highroad to Pekin, which is, in the opinion
of the Chinese, incomparably the finest road in the world.
To-day, however, we came across some really neatly-made
bridges in excellent repair, but evidently only intended for
travellers on foot or on horseback, as, at one end or the
other, there was invariably a gap some two feet wide,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377' href='#Page_377'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' name='Page_378' href='#Page_378'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' name='Page_379' href='#Page_379'>379</a></span>
effectually stopping wheeled traffic, so that all carts had
to go through the water. Ninety li was the day's
journey, taking us to Shih-Rong-Wa, where we stopped
the night.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">BUDDHIST TEMPLE. OUTSIDE KUEI HUA CHENG, CHINA.</p>
</div>

<p>
Next day was uneventful, but we ascended gradually to a
little village called Cha-Ha-Pa-La, 100 li, and got quite into
the mountains again, very different country from what we
had passed through since leaving Pao T'eo. The soil here
appeared very rich, and every available patch of land was
cultivated. Every day we used to pass through numerous
villages, and in one we were lucky enough to come in for a
theatrical entertainment. No village is without its theatre,
and performances are frequent in the season; but as it was
now the dull time we only saw one. The theatre is always
situated close to, generally opposite, the city temple, a great
convenience to the Taoist priests, who are also the theatrical
managers. The play did not appear exciting, and neither
of us understood a word of it, which was perhaps just as
well, so we left after a very few minutes. The theatres
being in the open, no entrance money is charged. The
audience come and go as they please, but are expected
to drop a small contribution into a collection box which
is continually being handed round. This system has the
further advantage of enabling the actors to converse freely
with friends below when not otherwise engaged.
</p>

<p>
From Cha-Ha-Pa-La we made an early start, as we heard
that the night's halting-place was to be a fair-sized town,
and we wanted to arrive early so as to renew our supplies.
We were pretty high up, and as it was now very near the
end of November, the mornings were uncommonly cold.
Rijnhart, Malcolm, Lassoo, and Esau all started walking,
while Shahzad Mir and I followed with the carts. Not far
from the village we crossed a low pass into a lovely wide
valley, and a little further on the party ahead managed to
take a wrong turn. I went on with the carts, and got to our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' name='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
midday halting-place about ten o'clock, and there I had to
sit and wait till the others should come up. I managed to
make out, by drawings in the dust and other devices, that
there was another road to Pekin, which the others must
have taken, and by which they would get to our destination
in seventeen days. Not thinking they were likely to be
quite so long in finding out their mistake, I resolved to
have my breakfast and await their arrival. After a couple
of hours' waiting I was beginning to get a little bit anxious,
and was considering what steps I had better take if, by any
chance, they did not arrive before nightfall. However, at
about one o'clock they hove in sight, so I immediately
had the mules harnessed, while Shahzad Mir warmed up
some tea.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Rijnhart and Malcolm were at the inn,
but the two men were some way behind, and while waiting
for them to come up, I heard how they had managed to
miss us. It appeared that, when they missed the road, all
the Chinese they had met had misled them by saying that
they were right, and it was not till late in the day that they
got into the proper road and arrived at the halting-place,
after walking fully thirty miles.
</p>

<p>
"We were soon ready for a fresh start, but the carters,
anxious for any excuse to back out of their agreement as
long as the fault could be laid at our door, were very
reluctant, but threats to cut off half their hire prevailed, and
we were quickly on the move. The march was a long one,
over rolling grassy plains, out of Chinese into Mongolian
country. As the sun set a cold wind rose, and for some time
we sat shivering on the carts. The carts were travelling
very fast, as the going was excellent. We thought we
should never get to our destination, but all the time we
were buoyed up with the thought that, at all events, we
should get to a big place where there was sure to be a good
inn. At last they told us that Ho-Lo-Si-T'ai, our goal,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' name='Page_381' href='#Page_381'>381</a></span>
was close by, and in a few minutes we saw, not the town
with castellated walls that we had imagined, but two miserable
wayside inns with large yards full of sheep and camels,
as unpromising a spectacle as one could wish to see.
</p>

<p>
On inquiry, things proved even worse than they had at
first appeared, for both inns were crammed full, and we
could not find a spot to sleep in. At last we heard that
there was a room in a small house close by, so round
we went, only to find it tenanted by a man, two women, a
sheep, and some children, a fair supply for a place about
twelve feet square, but into it we squashed, until we had
revived our circulation, and then, after a considerable
amount of squabbling, we arranged that we would sleep
in the carts, while the carters occupied the already overcrowded
room, for the simple reason that the carters flatly
refused to take us any further unless they slept inside the
house and we outside. Perhaps, after all, the cold blast
was preferable to dirt and a close atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
The following day our road lay over more grassy plains,
in which were herds of antelope—called by the Chinese
the "yellow sheep"—some sand-grouse, and a few great
bustards, none of which we shot. There were several
Mongol encampments, with their neat little circular dwelling-places
and sheep-folds, much more civilized than those
we had seen in the far west.
</p>

<p>
That evening we left the Mongol country, possibly for
ever, and got into the cultivated district again. The
change was very sudden, and showed us admirably how
the Chinese are slowly, but surely, encroaching upon the
country of their pastoral neighbours. Cha-Ha-La-Po, our
home for the night, was an insignificant little place, and
chiefly to be remembered for the fact that we there
managed to get rid of some six hundred very inferior cash,
brought from Shih-Tsui-Tsi.
</p>

<p>
At noon the next day we had to change our axles, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' name='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
roads from here being much narrower than they had
hitherto been; and while doing so we had a row with the
carters. A crowd promptly assembled, but Rijnhart soon
managed to get them on our side, and we gained our point.
We were now well within our time, and the carters knew
that they could fulfil their contract without difficulty, so
they loitered over the axle changing and made a very short
march to a brand-new inn, where we put up in an excellent,
clean, and airy room. There was still plenty of daylight
left, of which we took advantage to have a real good wash
in warm water.
</p>

</div>

<p>
As if to make up for this early halt, we were awakened
soon after midnight, and started about 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; but this
energy, we had every reason to believe, was owing to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
desire on the part of our jehus to pass through the next
village in the dark, owing to monetary or some other form
of trouble they were in there. At first it was very dark, and
as our road was very rough we went stumbling along till the
moon came out from behind some heavy clouds. Rising
rapidly, we were soon on a small pass, where some pious
individual, in hopes of future reward, had built a neat
little temple. The descent on the far side was steep, and
the rocky gorge through which our road lay was very
picturesque in the brilliant moonlight.
</p>

<p>
About daylight we got down to the bed of a stream,
which we crossed and recrossed several times till we
arrived at the small town of Hsing-Ping-Ho, the gate of
which forms part of the Great Wall of China. We had
already seen the Great Wall, near Chong Wei, where, however,
it is little more than a turf embankment, but as we
approached the capital we saw how it gradually improves,
both in its original construction and its later preservation;
but even now we were very much disappointed, and were
unable to realize how it ever managed to gain its world-wide
reputation.
</p>

<p>
At Hsing-Ping-Ho the wall is of earth, faced with brick,
generally not more than eight to ten feet high, and quite
narrow, very different from the imposing structure one had
always pictured it to be, and which we were yet destined to
see. But although we could not yet look upon the wall with
the respect one had hoped to feel for it, neither of us could
help admiring the dogged perseverance with which it has
been carried over mountain tops and down valleys, the
most forbidding natural obstacles being treated as nought
in comparison with the orders of the emperor.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast our road ran parallel to the stream we
had crossed in the morning, which had now grown to a
considerable size, and was called the Wo-Ku-Shan-Ho.
Every few miles we passed a large walled city, evidently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' name='Page_384' href='#Page_384'>384</a></span>
very old, and now almost entirely deserted; they must all
have seen better times and been places of importance—probably
about the time that the Great Wall was being built.
I photographed the walls of one of these cities, and the
temple outside tenanted by some wooden figures. The
name of the city was Si-Yang Ho.

CHAPTER XXXI.

<p class="ch_summ">
HOW TO MANAGE INN-KEEPERS AND CARTERS—SHUEN-HUA-FU—"SPIRIT'S
PAPER"—SHAHZAD MIR LOST AND FOUND—ESAU'S
PRESTIGE.
</p>

<p>
About dusk we got to a very small village, with a most
charming little inn. We got two very comfortable little
rooms, with excellent furniture, consisting of tables, chairs,
and looking-glasses.
</p>

<p>
This must have been quite one of the longest day's
journey we did, but li are very erratic things to go by. As
far as we could make out one hour's journey was always
counted as ten li, quite irrespective of whether we went
fast or slow; thus ten li in one place would be nearly
five miles, and in another very little over three.
</p>

<p>
Delighted as we had been on arrival with our little inn,
we were still more so on our departure, for we got off
without a word of dispute at the price to be paid for
our accommodation. At this time our rule was to pay one
hundred cash for each room occupied, and about forty cash
each for water and for the use of the fire; when nearer the
capital we increased this as the accommodation improved,
just as in the rough places further west we had given less.
Having a fixed rule like this, which was liberal without
being excessive, saved us an infinity of trouble, as the
innkeepers saw at once that Rijnhart knew what he was
about, and was not likely to be cheated or bluffed into making
exorbitant payments. But there was always one thing they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_387' name='Page_387' href='#Page_387'>387</a></span>
could not get over, and that was that Rijnhart always
handed them whatever money we took out of the bag and
gave him. They saw that we put ourselves in his hands, and
could not make out why he exacted no squeezes from us or
them; never was such honesty heard of!
</p>

<p class="caption">BRIDAL CHAIR.</p>
</div>

<p>
This day, the 23rd November, was evidently a very lucky
one: every one was out visiting friends, dressed in their
best, the big ceremonial hat was seen on all sides, and
several marriages were in progress. As if to make up for
our peaceful morning, we had a most truculent fellow to
deal with at breakfast; our cash were all too small and our
fees were quite insufficient; in fact, he found a <i>casus belli</i> in
our every act, and crowned his impertinences by selling us
some two dozen real bad eggs, at eight cash apiece.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a traveller is apt to find himself in a very
awkward position, if his carters and an offensive innkeeper
happen to be in league. It may happen that the carters
owe the innkeeper money, and the latter threatens to get
them punished unless they help him in extorting money
from the unfortunate foreigner; the innkeeper then demands
a perfectly unreasonable sum from his victim, which the
latter refuses; upon this the carters come up and say that
they cannot possibly leave till the money is paid, and the
helpless traveller finds himself between the devil and the
deep sea. Luckily for us, our agreement effectually stopped
any nonsense of this kind, for if the carters said they could
not go on, we at once replied, "All right, please yourselves—but
if you do not arrive by the 27th, you lose half your
hire."
</p>

<p>
Every day, now, villages became more numerous, and the
country was very thickly cultivated. We stopped a long
time at our midday halt at the city of Shuen-Hua-Fu,<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> as
the carters had to change some silver and transact some
business before proceeding. After leaving, we passed a very
large number of gravestones and memorial stones, with old
inscriptions of the rounded characters; the hillsides
on the left of the road were studded with them for
several miles, and in many places the coffins were sticking
out of the ground, where the earth had been washed
away from over them. On the road we met a convoy of
mules carrying boxes containing tins of oil from Batoum,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' name='Page_389' href='#Page_389'>389</a></span>
and another with silver; the latter had an escort armed
with spears decorated with red tassels, each mule, too,
was decorated with a red flag, the whole making quite
an imposing show.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening the road got very bad, and in one place
we all had to get out and steady the carts as they passed
down a steep, rocky path. Luckily we got down without
mishap, but one of the carts was within an ace of slipping
down a decline, where there was nothing to stop it for a
considerable distance, and where both it and the mules must
inevitably have been smashed. As we went down, a string
of carts was coming up, two or three teams being hitched on
to one cart and then returning for the next. The shouts of
the drivers, cracks of whips, and creaking of wheels, made
a terrible din, while the motley teams of ponies, mules,
donkeys, and bullocks, all straining every nerve and then
only managing to progress some ten or fifteen yards
without a rest, made a picture. I should very much like to
have been able to perpetuate it, but the light had already
failed, and I was unable to do so. It was dark when we got
down to Siao-Si-Fu and into our inn, but we had really
made quite a short day's journey.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we were up long before it was light, and
made a start with lanterns. It was just as well we did so,
for our landlord, who was evidently accustomed to foreigners,
and looked upon them as fair prey, refused to open the
gates of the inn yard unless we paid him far more than
was his due; but he reckoned without his host, for as there
was no crowd about, and no fear of exciting a disturbance,
we were able to threaten, and telling him that if he did not
undo the lock, we would blow it open with a revolver, he
soon saw that the game was up, and let us go in peace.
</p>

<p>
The village of Siao-Si-Fu lies just at the entrance of a
narrow gorge, through which runs a rapid stream; the road
winds along the hillside, generally at a good height above
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
the water, but it has been carefully made, and the going is
excellent. We met a large number of camels coming through,
mostly carrying tea into the interior; and in one place one
of them had managed to slip some distance down the hillside,
but did not appear to have hurt himself much—he had been
wise in choosing a gradual slope, where he could not fall far.
The defile lasted nearly ten miles, but we missed most of
its beauties, owing to our early start and the darkness,
which was also responsible for our party getting separated,
Shahzad Mir having somehow managed to lose the rest of
us. This did not cause us much anxiety at the time, as we
thought that he had merely lagged behind, and would soon
be up with us.
</p>

<img src="images/i-408.jpg" width="527" height="441" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A GORGE WITH GREAT WALL IN DISTANCE.</p>
</div>

<p>
When, however, we had made our halt, and breakfast was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
being prepared, and there were still no signs of him, we
began to get anxious, and in making inquiries, we heard
that he had passed our halting-place, and been met by
carters coming from the Pekin direction. We still consoled
ourselves with the thought that he would soon find out his
mistake and retrace his steps, but when it was time to yoke
up and make a fresh start, nothing had been seen of him.
</p>

<p>
We were now very anxious about him, so divided ourselves
into two parties, the carts and servants going one road,
while we went another, which passed through several small
towns and ran parallel to the road taken by the carts. Both
parties made inquiries as they went along, and for some
thirty li we still heard of him; he seemed to have walked
straight ahead, never stopping except to buy some food.
His clothes and gait, as well as his dark face, made him very
conspicuous, so that the various guards on the town gates
always noticed him; but after going about ten miles we lost
all trace of our faithful Duffadar, and all we could do was
to give notice of his disappearance in different places, and
ask the people to show him which way we had gone. The
most unlucky part of the business was that he could not
speak a solitary word of Chinese, and might get himself into
trouble, but fortunately we were in northern, and not central
or southern China, so we felt sure that sooner or later he
would turn up.<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a>
</p>

<p>
In some of the towns we passed through we saw quantities
of "spirit's paper" lying about the streets, or hanging up
in the shops for sale. This spirit's paper is simply round
pieces, cut to represent cash, each sheet of paper representing
any number, or gilt to represent silver or gold. These
are bought by the people and scattered about the houses, or
put in holes in walls and tree trunks, where they are found
by restless, wandering spirits, who, poor creatures, are easily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' name='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
deceived into thinking them offerings of great value, and
consequently refrain from injuring the pious, but economical
offerer. They also burn large quantities of this paper money,
and effigies of carts, horses, and other signs of worldly
wealth, all of which go to improve the social status of their
ancestors in the nether world.<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> The Chinaman, though
decidedly superstitious and pious, according to his lights,
rarely allows his regard for his ancestors to overcome that
for his own pocket.
</p>

<p>
This was to be another very long day, so we halted for an
hour, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and fed the animals,
we ourselves buying some splendid grapes for forty cash a
pound. These are grown south of the town of Shuen-Hua-Fu;
also quantities of millet (huang-mi<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>), which is ground up
and eaten like rice by the poor classes.
</p>

<p>
While wandering round, telling people of Shahzad Mir's
disappearance and looking at the various shops, we saw
hung up in a cage on the city gate the head of a man who
had been found guilty of theft, and next to this gruesome
relic were the shoes of several officials, whose ability or zeal
in discharge of their duties had merited this special distinction;
thus are the best and the worst of men's deeds kept
fresh in the minds of the Chinese people.
</p>

<p>
We were just about to make our third start for the day
when two Russian merchants entered our inn. We were
much struck by the promptitude with which they extracted
their revolvers from the sedan chairs in which they were
travelling, and placed them in handy and conspicuous
positions on top of their luggage. Curiously enough the only
language in which we could converse with them was Chinese,
which one man spoke fluently; and it was a great relief
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
when we learnt that we need have no fear of the Gulf of
Pe Chili being frozen over, for we were still in plenty of time.
</p>

<p>
We still had sixty li to do before halting for the night at
Huai-Lai-Hsien, so we shoved along as fast as the mules
could go, but the last twenty li or so were done in pitch
darkness and bitter cold. The gates of the suburb were
closed when we arrived, but we got them open with some
difficulty, after considerably exaggerating the importance of
the high official posts we both occupied. We had done
nearly fifty miles since morning, so were glad to get an
excellent Chinese concoction of eggs, and tumble into our
blankets as quickly as might be.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we had to wait till the main gates were
open, as our road lay through the city. The innkeeper
coolly demanded 1,160 cash for the use of his rooms, but
after a very few moments was more than satisfied with 360,
in addition to which we of course gave a <i>douceur</i> to the man
who had waited on us, as is the custom. A biting cold
wind was blowing from the west, and as it was also freezing
hard, it was quite the most unpleasant day of the whole
journey, but it was not till we got in the open country, outside
the walls, that we really felt the full force of the gale.
The road was crowded with travellers going to and from
Pekin, and one could not but envy the wealthy individuals
who, sitting snugly in their neatly-made sedan chairs, could
despise both wind and cold. Usually we used to wonder
how even a Chinaman could sit all day in one of these conveyances,
from which every breath of fresh air was carefully
excluded, but to-day I think we would gladly have got into
the stuffiest of them had we got the chance.
</p>

<p>
But if it were bad for us, what must it have been for the
people travelling against the wind? Time after time we
congratulated ourselves on the wind being at our backs.
Several unfortunate Russians whom we met looked as
though the wind was nearly cutting them in two, while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
Mongols and Chinese sat with their backs towards the
heads of their camels or mules as they rode along. One
poor man, whose whole attention was fixed on keeping himself
warm, was very nearly run over by our carts in spite
of all our warning shouts. Somehow, watching the misery
of others always makes one forget one's own, and we were
able to laugh at the ludicrous though pitiable faces of those
we met, and in this way the fifty li to Cha-Tao passed less
unpleasantly than it could otherwise have done.
</p>

<p>
Just before reaching this village we passed through
another of the many ramifications of the Great Wall,
behind which we cowered until the carts came up, wondering
all the time what had happened to the unfortunate Shahzad
Mir. Where could he have passed the night? What was
he doing now? How would he manage for food? These
and many other questions we asked one another, but
decided that the only way in which we could help him
was to get to Pekin quickly, and give notice at the yamen
there of his disappearance.
</p>

<p>
From the wall to the inn was a very short way, and soon
after the carts had come up we found ourselves in a crowded
inn, where every one was busy; all the travellers were shivering
like ourselves, and all clamouring for hot tea and other
luxuries. At length we managed to get something, and had
just got well into a substantial meal, when, to our surprise
and delight, Shahzad Mir strode into the yard. While some
food was being got ready for him he told us his tale.
After missing us in the dark, on the morning of the 25th,
he had quite made up his mind that we must be ahead, so
on and on he went, eventually leaving the right road to his
left. By midday he realized that he was lost, but this did
not seem to have bothered him in the least. He knew that we
were making for Pekin or Peh Chine, as the people call it,
and guessed that by repeating that word in an inquiring
tone of voice, he would get people to show him the road.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
He also knew that Pekin lay pretty well due east, so made
up his mind to hold his course in that direction until he
got to the sea, if necessary, after which he hoped to fall in
with some European who would help him. At nightfall
he thought he ought to try and get some food and lodging.
He was in a fair-sized town, so walked into the biggest
shop he could see, and made the owner understand his
wants. Food they gave him willingly, but it was some
time before he could get them to let him stay the night,
his dark-coloured face apparently filling them with awe;
but at last he attained his object, and got not only a good
night's rest, but a substantial meal before leaving in the
morning, for all of which his host absolutely refused
payment.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-413.jpg" width="520" height="418" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE GREAT WALL AT CHA-TAO.</p>
</div>

<p>
Somehow or other the dark complexions of our retainers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396' href='#Page_396'>396</a></span>
always struck awe into the minds of the Chinamen, and
time after time Rijnhart had to answer questions as to
whether these men were "really wild or not." Esau
especially, with his flowing Ladakhi locks and earrings,
was an object of fear and wonder, being taken for either
a woman or a cannibal, greatly to his own disgust, though
luckily he could not understand the remarks aroused by his
strange appearance, unless they were explained by Rijnhart
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast the wind dropped a bit, and the cold was
much less than it had been, for which we had reason to be
thankful, as about two li beyond Cha-Tao we passed through
the Great Wall again, and were able to see it at its best.
It is here made of rubble, and splendidly faced with stone;
towers are placed at regular intervals, and the top is broad
enough for any troops to pass one another without the
slightest difficulty or confusion. Just by the gate a flight
of steps leads up to the wall, from which we looked down
the valley towards Cha-Tao, and I also managed to take a
photograph showing the wall as it runs away over the hill
tops to the north.
</p>

<p>
One could now for the first time realize the magnitude
of the original design, and had the whole northern frontier
of China been divided off from Mongolia by a wall, such
as this is near Pekin, and some 1,600 miles in length,
there would have been nothing in the world to compare
with it. Just behind the wall we found an old cannon, the
inscription on which was copied by Rijnhart, as he believed
that it proved the gun to be some three thousand years
old, but unluckily we had no books at hand to corroborate
this idea, or to tell us how old it really was. The name of
the Emperor in whose reign it was made was very clear,
and a book of dates would show at once between what
years the gun was made.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile our carts had got some way ahead of us, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' name='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
we had to hurry after them. Ascending steadily we reached
the summit of the Nan Kou Pass, from which a rapid
descent into a warmer climate commenced. The road
was at this point by far the best we saw in China, and
showed signs of immense labour and no inconsiderable
amount of engineering skill having been expended on it.
Our road lay down a narrow valley, high on each side of
which rose rocky mountains, while along the northern
skyline ran the Great Wall.

<p>
As we descended we passed several small shrines and
numerous inscriptions cut in the face of the rock, many
of which were in ancient Tibetan characters, but more
remarkable than these was a large figure of Sakya Muni,
cut on a rock, which stands in a very conspicuous position
high above the road.
</p>

<p>
Rijnhart and Malcolm climbed by a steep staircase to a
small shrine, some eighty feet above the road; but although
it was evidently very old, they found nothing more remarkable
than the names of several Russians and a few Englishmen
who had been there in previous years, among others
being Grey, Walker, and Allen, 1868 and 1879. We did
not add our own to the list.

<p>
Still descending, we passed under several arches, which
looked as though they had at some time been gates of
different fortified camps, and then came to a magnificent
Buddhist arch covered with carvings and representations
of Buddha; this must be a great age, and is one of the
most interesting relics in Northern China. A short way
further on we came to the village of Nan Kou (southern
valley), where visitors to the Great Wall almost always stop
the night after leaving Pekin. Knowing this, we were quite

but the demands with which we were met far exceeded our
expectations. In the first place, we could get no fire on
which to cook our own food, but must take what the inn
provided; then our servants could not cook their food; and
lastly, we must pay for everything over-night, and not wait
till the morning, as had been our invariable custom. Eventually
these little difficulties were settled, but not until our
landlord had worked himself up into a towering passion,
such as only a Chinaman can, and had stamped up and
down the room like a mad man.
</p>

<p>
Now came the great question. We were prepared to settle
over-night. But how much were we to pay? "A Chinaman
always pays a thousand cash for this room. What are you
going to give me?" said Mr. Khe, the innkeeper. "Three
hundred cash," we replied, now thoroughly annoyed, and
with our liberal intentions all forgotten. "Well, what about
the servants?" was his answer. "They are included," was
all the reply he got. Never have I seen a man change
his demeanour as our friend now did. From the bullying
tone he had previously adopted he became quite cringing,
and, seeing that we knew the exact amount to which he was
entitled, and that we were determined to pay no more,
quietly said, "Very well, give me the money," which we did,
explaining that but for his insolent behaviour we should
have given him about double. This had a most salutary
effect on his servants, so that next morning they were all
running about with hot water for our tea, and doing other
little services, which were rewarded with extra wine money.
I was amused to hear later that every one who stays in this
inn has a row with the landlord, but it is not every one who
gets out of it as well as we did.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we made a very early start, hoping to reach
the capital and get our letters in good time. It was now
more than six months since we had heard from home, and
we were, naturally, a little anxious as to what news might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
be awaiting us. For some days the traffic had been rapidly
increasing. All night one could hear the camel bells ringing
as they passed our inns,<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> while all day we passed
string after string of pack mules and carts. But to-day far
surpassed everything we had yet seen. In one hour, just
before daybreak, Rijnhart and I counted no less than 765
camels, all carrying tea, sugar, and oil to the interior,
while those travelling east were mostly laden with wool.
</p>

<p>
Just below Nan Kou the road, which for the last few days
had lain through rocky mountains, debouched on the wide
"Plain of Pe Chili," in which lies Pekin, and where are
also the famous "Tombs of the Emperors." As we neared
the great city we crossed some fine stone bridges, which
must have been quite wonders when originally built in the
days of long ago, but, as little care is now taken about
keeping them in order, the roadways are very rough.
Here it was that we got our best opportunity of studying
the crowd that was hurrying to the capital, all bent on
business or pleasure.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost in interest was an important Mongolian
prince, decorated with the dark red button and surrounded
by an escort whose faces plainly told their nationality. From
one of them we learnt that their chief had been hastily summoned
into the presence of the Emperor, and was travelling
with all possible speed. Just behind his sedan chair came
a coffin with its inevitable accompanying rooster, while,
indifferent alike to the living prince or the dead commoner,
a mass of jostling, bustling humanity, neat little private
mule carts, rougher hired ones, country waggons, and people
on foot, all hurrying on and looking after themselves alone,
crossed the bridge in front of us, a mass of colour and
Chinese life worth going a long way to see.

</p>

<p>
Here, too, for the first time, we saw Chinese women with
decent sized feet. This is owing to the fact that from
mixing with Manchus and other foreigners they have seen
the error of their ways, and the younger generation are, to a
great extent, forsaking the folly of their ancestors. The
treatment necessary to produce a really neat Chinese foot,
the best examples of which are to be seen in Lancheo,
is absolutely barbarous. First, slits are made between the
metatarsal bones to enable the toes, except the big toe, to
be bent well under the sole. Then a similar cut is made in
the heel, so that it can be bent to nearly meet the toes, the
whole foot being tightly bound round and held in position
with bandages. The unfortunate child-cripple is now left
to walk about on the stumps until the agony becomes
unbearable, when the foot is released till the following day.
Needless to say, a free, easy gait is an impossibility, and
how such deformity can be considered becoming passes all
understanding. Shahzad Mir summed up the Chinese
race in the words, "All the women are lame, and the men
rotten with opium," by no means an unfair description.
</p>

<p>
Coming from India, the effects of opium on the people
strike one perhaps more forcibly than they would do otherwise.
In both countries there is a large consumption, but,
instead of smoking in the Chinese fashion, the inhabitants
of India either eat it or drink a decoction of it. As was
shown before the Opium Commission in 1894, the good
effects of the drug in India more than counterbalance the
evil effects, but there can be no mistake as to its being an
unmitigated curse in China, where many of its slaves would
gladly give it up if they could, but the craving it induces is
too strong to be combated by nature alone.
</p>

<p>
Manchu women, with their carefully dressed hair sticking
out on either side of the head, and their curious shoes, were
the next curiosity to attract our attention, but all these
were soon dwarfed into insignificance by the appearance, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' name='Page_406' href='#Page_406'>406</a></span>
the distance, of the west gate of Pekin, but, though still
early when first seen, it was three o'clock in the afternoon
before we arrived in the suburb.
</p>

<p>
Here carts had to be changed, as the large country carts
are not allowed into the city, and this proved to be another
bone of contention between ourselves and our carters, they
contending that we ought to get our own carts from the city,
while we said it was part of their contract, but this little
matter was soon smoothed over, and our belongings were
transferred into our new conveyances.
</p>

<p>
The streets of Pekin were at first a little disappointing,
the walls are in many places dilapidated, and drainage
there is nil, but at the present time our thoughts were all
centred on getting our letters. The drive through the city
to the "Hotel de Pekin" took us three quarters of an hour.
There we secured most luxurious quarters, and then rushed
off to the post office. Here we heard that all our letters
had been sent round to the Embassy, so off we went again,
but it was not without some difficulty that we obtained
admission.

</div>

<p>
Sergeant Herring,<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> who for twenty-five years has guarded
the portals of the British Minister's residence, looked at us
in considerable astonishment, as well he might. Never had
he seen in all his experience two such disreputable looking
beings. At length we allayed his suspicions, and our
names were taken in to Sir Claude Macdonald, who received
us with the greatest kindness, but perhaps the strangest
sensation of the whole journey was still in store for us
when, covered as we were with the grime of our eight
months' travel, we suddenly found ourselves in Lady
Macdonald's drawing-room, from which we beat a hasty
retreat, but not before we had promised to bring our things—such<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_407' name='Page_407' href='#Page_407'></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
things too—over from the hotel in the morning. We
had been expected in Pekin in September, and every one
had come to the conclusion that we must have returned
to India by some other route, so the news of our arrival
was promptly telegraphed to London.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">STREET WHEREIN IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE BRITISH LEGATION.</p>
</div>

<p>
Every hour of our short stay in Pekin passed most
pleasantly. Unfortunately, the chance of getting frozen
in was increasing day by day, and our time was not our
own, so we were only able to enjoy a three days' stay in
the place which had taken us so long to reach. Nearly all
this time we spent wandering about the streets, buying
curios of all sorts, but one wants a great deal longer than
this to exhaust the sights of China's capital, with its
three cities, one within the other, and its narrow, busy
streets and bazaars. A walk round the walls and a visit
to the Observatory, where the finest bronzes in the world
are to be seen, were amongst the good things we missed,
but somehow or other the more we got to know the streets
the greater attraction they had for us, especially as at this
time of year they are free from those appalling smells with
which all visitors to China have made us familiar.
</p>

<p>
During our short stay we met among other Englishmen
Sir Robert Hart, who has been for forty-two years in the
service of the Chinese Government, with only eighteen
months' leave home, and Colonel Brown, who had just
come out from home by the Trans-Siberian Railway—a
very pleasant but cold journey—to take up the duties of
military attaché.
</p>

<p>
All too soon the day of our departure arrived, and
the 1st December saw us again packed in Chinese carts, on
the way to Tientsin, where we arrived on the night of the
2nd, our last day's travelling in China having been nearly
our longest, as we covered no less than 150 li between
1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and 6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Greatly did we miss Rijnhart, the
cheery companion of our forty days through China. His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' name='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>412</a></span>
original intention had been to travel with us by sea to
Shanghai, but, at the last moment, he decided to accompany
a German traveller, Mr. Eugène Wolf, overland to Hankow,
so with real regret we parted from him at Pekin.
</p>

<p>
We were now without an interpreter, and at Tientsin
were unable to find our way to the hotel, so lost considerable
time wandering about the streets, asking futile questions
from passers-by, and abusing our carters. At last things
came to a climax, when one of them drove into a water cart,
upsetting it with all its water into the street. Before we
really knew what had happened, two of our carters were
seized and marched off to the nearest police station.
</p>

<p>
We were thus left in a fine predicament. There we were
in a strange place, unable to speak the language, two of our
carters in prison, and the other one refusing to budge till
his companions had been released. Such was our first
experience of European administration in a Chinese town.
There was only one course left to us. We turned carters
ourselves, and as we made our way we knew not whither,
we fortunately fell in with an intelligent native, who sprang
up from somewhere or other, and volunteered to show us
the way to an hotel. Driving ourselves, and following our
friend in need, we soon arrived at the "Globe Hotel," but
here again we were looked upon with the gravest suspicion,
and only with the greatest difficulty did we manage to
secure one small room between us. A little later, when
our landlord found out who we were, he was profuse in
his apologies, and anxious to put us into better quarters,
explaining that he had at first taken us for robbers. This
was rather hard, after having had baths regularly for the
last four days, having shaved our beards, and having
borrowed clothes from Mr. Hugh Grosvenor at Pekin,
but it made us realize what a shock we must have given
Lady Macdonald on our first appearance in her drawing-room.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p class="ch_summ">
BACK TO INDIA—DISILLUSIONMENT OF OUR FOLLOWERS WITH
REGARD TO SOME OF THE BLESSINGS OF CIVILIZATION—MILITARY
HOSPITALITY—RETURN TO CALCUTTA.
</p>

<p>
We had just got into our fresh quarters when our carters
turned up. They had received a severe beating for their
carelessness, and had then been released. We paid them
both off, and were not sorry at the thought of having seen
the last of the Chinese muleteer.
</p>

<p>
At dinner that night we met a Mr. Denbigh, who is
engaged in large business transactions in Saghalien,
Vladivostock, and Japan, and who was now supplying
sleepers for the new railway to Pekin. He made a most
tempting offer, which we could not accept, namely, that we
should accompany him in a ship he had chartered, run over
in her to Japan, and then either go on in her to Canton, or
change into one of the regular liners to Shanghai and
Hong Kong. Next morning, as soon as breakfast was over,
we went with Mr. Denbigh to try and fit ourselves out with
some new clothes, but we did not succeed in getting much
beyond stockings and shoes. We then went to the office of
Messrs. Forbes &amp; Co., and presented our letters, showing
the amount we had drawn from their various agents, and
settled the account in English money.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon we met Mr. W. H. Forbes, an Edinburgh
man, who told us that our quickest route would be to go by
a steamer belonging to Messrs. Butterfield and Swire, called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' name='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
the <i>Nanchang</i>, one of the very few running direct to Hong
Kong. This would save several days, but would not allow
of our seeing Shanghai; but time outweighed all other
considerations, and we practically decided at once to adopt
this course. In the evening we dined with Surgeon-Major
Henston and the mess of the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Company, being treated on all hands with the
greatest possible kindness.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we finally decided to go by the <i>Nanchang</i>
direct to Hong Kong, and, with a view to this, we went
round to Messrs. Butterfield and Swire's office. Here we
learnt that, by taking the midday train to Tong Ku, we
should get on board comfortably before dark. This sounded
simple enough, but we still had something to learn with
regard to Chinese travelling.
</p>

<p>
From Tientsin to Tong Ku is about thirty miles, and
two trains run daily each way. Ships can come up the river
as far as Tientsin, but, at this time of year, they seldom
care to run the risk of being frozen in. We arrived at the
railway station in good time, and there found a scene of
the most horrible confusion. As soon as the train came
alongside the platform, there was a general rush for the
carriages, and every seat was taken. Not being accustomed
to this sort of thing, we got left, but by the kindness of
a Dr. Irwin, and a very nice Chinese official, we managed
to put our servants and our baggage into an open waggon,
while we ourselves travelled in the brake van.<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a>
</p>

<p>
There was a bitterly cold wind blowing, fortunately at
our backs, so we kept the brake door open for fresh air
only having to shut it when the train stopped. Had the wind
been against us, our servants would have had a very poor
time. We found, however, that we had a great pull over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
people in the carriages, for we had a stove on which we
roasted chestnuts the whole way to Tong Ku.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese gentleman to whom we were indebted for
our seat in the train had been educated in America and
spoke English fluently; he was a very go-ahead man, and
was very anxious that the management of the railway
should be put into the hands of foreigners, as the Chinese
officials were quite helpless. But, with all his admiration
for foreign products, he said that there was one thing he
could get in China to suit him, and nowhere else, that was
"spectacles." He certainly wore a splendid pair, for which
he had given Ts.80—a very heavy price, but the glasses
were extraordinarily good.
</p>

<p>
This was the first railway Esau and Lassoo had ever
seen. They had long been looking forward to it, and had
asked us many questions as to how the train moved, etc.,
but I am afraid their first experience was not an encouraging
one.
</p>

<p>
On our arrival at Tong Ku, we heard that the <i>Nanchang</i>
had gone outside the bar to complete her cargo, but no one
could tell us how to get out to her. After walking for about
a mile we came to the end of the wharf, and, by pure good
luck, found a tug just on the point of leaving. "Where is
the <i>Nanchang</i>?" we shouted. "I'm going to take a lighter
out there at once; look sharp, if you're coming on board,"
was the reply. The tug began to move, but our repeated
shouts brought it to a standstill. The pilot was an impatient
man, and our coolies who carried our goods were
tardy men, so that we just, and only just, managed to
tumble our things and ourselves on board before the tug
was in motion again.
</p>

<p>
As soon as our pilot had tugged us out alongside the
lighter, he advised us to go aboard it with our luggage, and
as we knew the <i>Nanchang's</i> cargo was on board also, we
felt we could not be left behind. The pilot, too, promised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' name='Page_418' href='#Page_418'>418</a></span>
that if he could not get us alongside the <i>Nanchang</i> that
night, he would take us ashore to the hotel at Taku. It was
bitterly cold as we scrambled from the tug into the lighter,
and whilst our servants barricaded themselves from the
cruel blast with our boxes and rugs, Malcolm and I gladly
stepped below and partook of the small space available,
and of the rough though kind hospitality of the uncouth
Chinese crew. As we felt ourselves being tugged out to
sea it grew colder and colder. At length, soon after nightfall,
to our dismay, the pilot faithlessly deserted us. Visions
of beds at the Taku Hotel vanished, to be replaced by the
flow of wrath we would let the pilot have on the morrow.
The only course left to us was to make the best of our
situation. As we had made no provision for food, we asked
our rough hosts, by signs, what they could give us for
dinner. This finally was served up, consisting of tea and
monkey-nuts. We smiled at one another as we did ample
justice to our last Chinese meal, and prayed that we might
never fare worse.
</p>

<p>
I don't know how long I had slept, but suddenly I awoke.
There was considerable hubbub aloft, and somehow I felt
that we were dragging our anchor and drifting out to sea.
Rushing up on deck, I found the wind was blowing so hard
that, instead of an anchor, we were using a bit of a sail,
and that after all I had needlessly left the warmth below.
Soon after daybreak we saw a tug coming towards us, but,
alas! were unable to vent our wrath on our last night's
pilot, for this one proved to be another tug. This quickly
brought us alongside the <i>Nanchang</i>, where we were at first
pointed out as being two Russians, but further acquaintance
with the hardy and kind-hearted skipper and hospitable
officers soon dissolved their first opinion. The <i>Nanchang</i>
had comfortable quarters for two passengers, with a liberal
table. The cargo consisted of Chinese wine, nuts and
bones, which latter are utilised for some process in refining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_419' name='Page_419' href='#Page_419'>419</a></span>
sugar. We ourselves never approved of the process, for
on a roughish day the odours from these bones were not
always welcome.
</p>

<p>
The following morning, the 6th December, we rose to
find ourselves almost blocked in with white drifting masses
of ice—quite a Nansenic scene. It seemed as though we
could have walked for miles over the sea. Our weather-beaten
skipper far from cheered us when he began to
narrate how, a year or two ago, he had been caught by the
winter just in the same way, and his ship had been blocked
for some months. He graphically told us how they used to
walk to shore, and of the jolly parties they had at the Taku
Hotel! Our heads, however, were turned in a different
direction; we were bound to return to India with the least
possible delay, and we shuddered to think of our fate.
Providentially the weather changed, our last cargo of bones
was brought on board, as well as a third and welcome
passenger, Mr. Carville, of the Consulate Service. By 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
we were once more under weigh, steaming some ten knots
an hour.
</p>

<p>
Here, again, Esau and Lassoo began to enjoy a new
experience, for they had never seen a big boat. Shahzad
Mir had certainly seen one, though he had never made
a voyage. Amongst other topics, on cold, still nights, on
that vast expanse of unknown land, we had told them of
the big ships, and their faces had brightened up as they
pictured the leisure, comfort, and ample supply of everything
that was in store for them. But, alas! the next
morning, with a beam sea on, the three men lay prone,
miserable, and unable to eat, while around lay the box of
cigars we had provided them with. Poor fellows! they
wished they were back again on the Chang, even along the
shore of one of those dreary salt lakes. Though smiling at
their unfortunate plight, we sincerely pitied them, and felt
that it was but a poor return, after all the troubles and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' name='Page_420' href='#Page_420'>420</a></span>
privations they had undergone for us. We were heartily
glad to find the beam sea was of but short duration, and
with its abatement our three men revived sufficiently to
enjoy the remainder of the voyage to Hong Kong.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Landing at Quarry Bay at daybreak on the 12th of
December, we then embarked on a small steamer, which
speedily carried us up the beautiful harbour to one of
the wharfs. From thence we made our way to the
Hong Kong Hotel, and learnt there was a boat, the
<i>Suisang</i>, leaving for Calcutta that very day at noon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' name='Page_421' href='#Page_421'>421</a></span>
All thoughts of visiting Canton were put aside—before
even we had managed to fit ourselves out for this last
stage of our travels, we had embarked on board this fine
boat; but whatever requirement we had been unable to
procure during so short a time our generous skipper,
Captain Galsworthy, was only too anxious to provide.
Our voyage was as pleasant as it is possible for a voyage
at sea to be.
</p>

<p>
On the 18th of December we touched at Singapore, where
we thoroughly enjoyed the ever-ready hospitality of the
1st Battalion Rifle Brigade, who were quartered there.
A dinner at mess, a stroll afterwards in the magnificent
gardens, as we listened meanwhile to the music of their
fine band, told us only too surely that our journey was
drawing to a close.
</p>

<p>
On the 21st we touched at Penang, of well-known
beauty, where the hospitality of the detachment of the
Rifle Brigade quartered there was only equalled by that
we had enjoyed at Singapore.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday, the 27th December, about 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, we were
waiting for a pilot to come and take us safely up the
Hoogly. As we gingerly glided up this changeable river
we passed several boats outward bound. From each we
endeavoured, by shouting, to learn the latest news, namely,
who had won the Viceroy's Cup. Finally, a sportsman
from some cargo boat, determined that we should know,
shouted out as few men can, for we just heard "Patiala's
Sprightly." At evening we had come to anchor, and early
the next morning were once more back in India.
</p>

<p>
It was no small pleasure to Malcolm and me to see
the delight of our three faithful followers, as they proudly
tramped through the busy streets of Calcutta with money
in their pockets to buy whatever their minds should fancy—they
were, indeed, a conspicuous little party, with their
weather-worn faces, and apparel made up from bits bought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' name='Page_422' href='#Page_422'>422</a></span>
at all the places we had been to; with the astonishment,
too, depicted on the faces of Esau and Lassoo, and the well-earned
swagger that our Duffadar wore, as he explained
this and that to his two bewildered companions.
</p>

<p>
But, apart from their outward appearance, which made
them so conspicuous amongst the Calcutta citizens, still
greater notice would have been taken of them had it been
known how willingly and faithfully they had served us
under circumstances and at times which must have been far
more trying to them than to ourselves. Like our predecessor,
Bower, we found the hardest task of our journey
was to part with these three followers. Good fellows,
how glad they were to be allowed to keep the enamelled
plates which we had carried for so many miles, not so
much to eat from as for digging holes in our continual
search for water!

Duffadar Shahzad Mir, who all through had worked
with unrivalled determination, joined his regiment, the
11th Bengal Lancers, at Nowshera, while Esau and Lassoo
returned to their homes in Leh. Wherever they may
be, they will at any rate have two friends in the world
who can never forget them.

I am not sure which, so have given the lesser number in the
text. This, is, of course, only since he became an incarnate saint;
there are no records of his previous lives. Sakya Muni had altogether
551 lives, 510 of which were prior to his becoming a saint.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_8'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_8'>[8]</a></span> Mina Fu-yeh's abbotship came to rather an abrupt termination
owing to a quarrel with another influential Buddha called Shertoch
Fu-yeh. At the time of the rebellion the priests were greatly exercised
in their minds as to whether they should fight against the rebels or
not. Most of the older men said that fighting was no part of a priest's
duty, while the younger men were keen to be in the thick of it. Mina
Fu-yeh, who was then abbot, said that they should not go out to fight,
but that they should make every preparation, and if the monastery
was attacked they should defend it to the last, otherwise they ought
not to mix in worldly strife. This did not please the war party, who
were headed by Shertoch Fu-yeh, and who made up their minds that
fight they would. They went out on three separate occasions, and
without doing any good; several were killed, a terrible thing for a
devout Buddhist, for he who dies a violent death is reincarnated in an
animal, and must complete a cycle of sixty lifetimes before he can
again become a man. This made the war party even more bitter
against Mina Fu-yeh, as they realised how much wiser the course he
had recommended would have been, and so inimical did they become
that he had to resign his post and for some time was in fear of his life.
Most of them speak rather disparagingly of his successor, who is, they
said, an insignificant Buddha, only in his third or fourth lifetime.

it is a Hsien. A Fu as nearly as possible corresponds to our "city"
and a "Hsien" is only equal to a town, while a "Ting" is a place
of the third class. A "Pu," properly speaking, means a fort, and
appears to be equal to a "Ting" in importance. In some instances a
city may have risen or fallen in importance since its title was originally
fixed, such as, for instance, the city of Siao-Si-Fu, which is not much
larger than a "Ting." In all towns of importance there is a yamen
or magistrates' office, and the head civil official there is called a Fut'ai
or Hsient'ai, as the case may be. In any large district there is also
a higher official called a Taot'ai.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
